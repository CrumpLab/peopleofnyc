The General Slocum disaster was one of the deadliest maritime disasters in U.S. history. It occurred on June 15, 1904, when the steamship General Slocum caught fire and sank in the East River of New York City. The ship was carrying over a thousand people, mostly women and children from the German-American community who were on a church outing.

The disaster was a result of a combination of factors, including outdated safety measures and equipment, lack of proper training and inspections, and negligence on the part of the ship's crew. The lifeboats on board were rotten and unusable, and the life jackets were filled with cork that had disintegrated over time, rendering them useless. The crew was not trained to handle emergencies, and the ship's owner had not conducted proper safety inspections.

As a result of the fire, many passengers were trapped below deck and unable to escape. Others jumped into the river, but many of them could not swim and drowned. The fire burned so intensely that many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. In total, over a thousand people lost their lives in the disaster, the majority of whom were women and children.

The disaster had a significant impact on the German-American community, who had been the primary passengers on the ship. The tragedy was felt deeply, and many families were devastated by the loss of loved ones. The disaster led to changes in safety regulations, including stricter inspections and requirements for safety equipment, to prevent similar tragedies in the future.

Captain William Van Schaick was the captain of the General Slocum when it caught fire and sank. He was found guilty of criminal negligence in the disaster and sentenced to 10 years in prison. However, he was released after serving less than four years due to good behavior. After his release, he was unable to find work as a captain and worked as a clerk until his death in 1927.
