Experience magic… Ever seen Netflix's show Bridgeton? Bridgeton is a show based on history, royalty and standards in areas such as England. However, the show differs in an important way in the fact that it goes against history's societal standards. If you have ever watched the show you know that there is a white and black cast in the series. This is all addressed by the show due to the king and queens union, a black queen and white king uniting adjacent societies all over England. If you've loved the show and like to experience it- the new Bridgeton palace opened in Manhattan just last year. This 19th century based series and all its drama, style, and people is now in action since April of this year.

Tickets to attend the Bridgeton Ball Experience range from $39 to about $80 dollars per person depending on what area of the ball you want to be in. Admission into the crowd is the lowest price while admission to the Queen's court is more expensive. At the Bridgeton Ball you'll experience a section of what it is like to live like royalty. Now like any ball you must wear a gown, bonus points if it is a gown from the regency era or earlier. At the ball there will be dancing, cocktails provided, live music, and a few performances. Thanks to the actors in the ball room's hard work, it truly feels like you are in an actual ball during the 19th century.

When you first step into the ball, that will be your time to mingle. Meet new people or explore with a group of friends- maybe even try to catch the queen's eye. You'll want to do this for later if you have admission into the queen's court.

An hour or so later, it will be about time for the queen to choose her diamond of the evening. Each of the ladies in court will have a chance to show a first impression to the queen- and whoever the queen chooses in the show was seen as the 1st woman men can come to to marry. In the ball, after the ladies have made an impression it is now time for the second part of the process which is dancing. The queen will observe her ladies in court during these first hours and notice he posture, dress, smile, ability to dance, mingle, etc. If you somehow dazzle the queen during the ballroom dance, she will bring you to the stage and you will become the diamond of the “season.” As the chosen one, you step on stage in the center and silver like confetti rains all over you as the queen's diamond and everyone cheers and applauds for your achievement.

After the queen's diamond has been chosen, it is now time to enjoy the rest of the ball for the evening. For the remaining hours there will be lots of live music and performances displaying the love between Bridgeton's represented relationships such as the Duke and Duchess in season one of the show.

And there you have it. You get all dressed up as a prince, princess, etc to experience the 19th century balls that occurred during the time period. Royal dreams have come true in such a unique and fashionable experience that the Bridgeton Ball Experience brings to many.
