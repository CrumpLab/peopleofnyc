Brooklyn Museum is the second largest museum in New York City. It is home to many different unique art pieces and performances. The museum was built in 1897 and it was one of the very first museums to display African art and culture. The genre ranges from European to Greek across the entire institution. Feel free to stop by as there are constant events, art shows, and displays always there at your disposal.

The ticket prices for the Brooklyn Museum range from \$10- \$40 depending on what you want to explore. As always, tickets are discounted for all students to attend the museum. You can even choose to go on guided tours of the museum, attend shows, and more. However despite these nagging prices for tickets, you can possibly attend the museum for free if you join on what is known as the first Saturday.

The first Saturday is a monthly event that the Brooklyn Museum has every Saturday that comes first in each month. During this event, the general admission to the museum is completely free for every one who wants to join. It is best to hurry in purchasing the tickets for First Saturday a couple weeks in advance because registration for the events fills up very fast. If by any means registration fills up and you still want to attend, if you purchased a membership at the museum, it is still possible to attend for free admission.

The Brooklyn Museum has many different pieces of works and art. One area that is particularly lively with colors and creative/graphic is the American exhibition. The exhibition is very diverse ranging from people and objects of all different colors, shapes, sizes, and etc. Touring the American exhibition is such a unique experience because through simple pictures or objects can spread such a powerful message about American society and its evolution.

Many art pieces depict figures of many important time periods. The early 1900s during the Harlem Renaissance, the Women's movement (late 1900s), and etc. The Harlem Renaissance was a lively time period for African American culture and art representation. It was a time for African American society to build its community and identity in order to rise up beyond a time where they were severely dehumanized. The above photo depicts a woman who is a working African American during the early 1900s in the time of the Harlem Renaissance a s described by the artist. The symbolic photo shows how African American women persevered and broke through stereotypical barriers that made it very difficult to integrate into American society after slavery.

The Women's movement was a growing cultural turning point in American society in the late 1900s. This was an era where women were trying to defeat the patriarchal society that America was based off on. The ultimate goal was of course an equal society between men and women or more of an established matriarchy. The vase shown above displays a famous woman figure known as Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was a woman born in 1933 and one of the first women who attended Harvard Law School and became a lawyer, known in that time as a man's profession. She also worked her way up and ended up becoming one of the first women to be on the Supreme Court. Ginsburg was a powerful catalyst in the women's movement and constantly proved that women are capable of achieving any goals and dreams that a man can.

The art pieces in Brooklyn Museum or of vastly different genres and time periods in history. It is interesting to see many of these different pieces collectively together in one room. There are many other genres that the museum displays beside the American exhibition such as Greece, Ancient times, African fashion, and etc. For a more in-depth analysis on the world's history you can take a tour across all the exhibitions the museum has to offer.
