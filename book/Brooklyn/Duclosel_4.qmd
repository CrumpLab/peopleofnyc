Hungry and looking for outdoor foods and treats? Hop on down to Smorgasburg and fill those tummies! Smorgasburg is a conjoined food market of different vendors that provide meals, drinks, and desserts. They are opened once a week and have three different locations, one in Prospect Park (Sundays), Williamsburg(Saturdays), and on Fulton Street/Church Avenue-World Trade Center(Fridays).

The idea of Smorgasburg was created in 2011 from the idea of community farmer's markets. It has now grown into a huge network of vendors selling their outdoor food items and has locations all throughout New York City.

In prospect park, expect to see a whole lot of tents and a whole lot of people. Enter your first Sunday on a warm sunny day. You see dozens of tents and wonder what to choose. Then you stand online to see that the line is relatively short and moving quickly. This is because with Prospect Park's 80+ vendors there are many options at your disposal. Try everything, within reason of budget of course. Every tried lamb on stick? Head on down to D'Abruzzo for a selection of chicken, beef, lamp, or a mix of all three of your kabobs. Just want a burger? Head on over to Burger Supreme for a delicious meal.

Enjoy nature along with your meal. Prices vary from vendor to vendor, but when buying such delicious foods, start with something small, then a meal, and then get something to take home. This ensures you try out everything you're interested in and save as much money as possible!

If you don't want to wait on any kind of line and just get your food right away there is an option to order your food online. The app is referred to as ChowNow and you can online order any meal from any store you want and be there to pick it up.

Most importantly, Smorgasburg is an outdoor dinning market that has many diverse and delicious foods. One classic favorite is the vendor market known as Bunan. This is a Haitian restaurant that sells different style foods than most Haitian restaurants. They offer in total three different types of meals, the plantain sandwich, sweet plantain boats, or plantain chip nachos. The most classic meal is the Plantain Sandwich which has a bread-like topping of two fried plantains. With any meal you get, you then have a choice to choose your meats. For this they have Griot pork, jerk chicken, mushroom, red snapper, or slider plantains. The price will vary depending on the meat you choose. And last but certainly not least comes the toppings. In the topping they offer caramelized onions, red cabbage slaw, pkliz (shredded carrots, onions, and peppers), and a secret sauce. You can top this off with one of the few drinks they have to offer such as the passion fruit lemonade that comes with your dense meal.
