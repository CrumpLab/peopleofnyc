The Canarsee Indians lived largely undisturbed until almost 150 years after European settlers arrived in nearby Gravesend in 1643. In the 18th century, the Wyckoff and Lott families established homesteads and built farms in the area. The Henry and Abraham Wyckoff House, built in 1766, still stands today on the corner of Kings Highway and East 22nd Street. One Wyckoff family home is the Pieter Claesen House, built in 1652 in what is now Flatlands, Brooklyn and believed to be the oldest surviving home in the City. Restored in 1982, the Pieter Claesen House is now a public museum. The Hendrick I. Lott House, built in 1720 and enlarged in 1800, is another landmark home in Flatlands, standing on East 36th Street. 

Fishing in the bay became popular in the early 1800s, and little cottages soon dotted the rim of the inlet. Sheepshead Bay, named after the type of fish, has been a spot for fishing, sailing, and other maritime activities since pre-colonial times. It was originally part of the Coney Island Creek. In the 1840s and before, Sheepshead Bay was a secluded fishing and farming community. It became an early vacation destination in the summers starting in 1840. Benjamin Freeman, who owned much of the land around the bay, became one of the first entrepreneurs to open a hotel here in 1844. He called it The Sheepshead, named after the type of common variety marine fish. This would give the area its unusual name. Tourists came in the mid-19th century, when Sam Leonard’s Hotel and Tappen’s Hotel were built. The opening of Ocean Avenue provided the first direct route to the area. 

During the mid and late 19th century, the bay area did not have the same luxurious reputation as Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach. In the 1870s, a large farm was subdivided for development and began a trend that led to the construction of more than 400 houses by the end of the century, along with shops, churches, and a post office. Seafood restaurants and other businesses began to pop up along Emmons Avenue. The Ocean Avenue Footbridge dates back to 1880 when it was built by Austin Corbin. The bridge allows people to cross the bay, and connects Sheepshead Bay from Emmons Avenue and East 19th street to Manhattan Beach. 

Sports defined the early recreations of Sheepshead Bay, and it was not just fishing and boating. In 1880, the Coney Island Jockey Club created a racetrack, which led to a population growth in the surrounding areas of the Bay. This was a popular draw due to the Gilded Age moguls who funded the venture, including the godfather of horse racing August Belmont Jr.

In around 1900, Capital James W. Corrigall created a ferry service that transported people from Sheepshead Bay to Plum Beach, a neighborhood where many locals had summer bungalows. In 1911, the Sheepshead Bay Race Track also served as a runway for the Vin Fiz, piloted by Calbraith P. Rodgers, when it made the world’s first transcontinental flight. When racetrack betting became illegal in the 1910s, the track was refitted for auto racing. One Sheepshead Bay “race” had been between an automobile driven by Italian racing legend Dario Resta and an airplane steered by pioneering pilot Katherine Stinson.

The Sheepshead Speedway replaced the track when the Jockey Club disbanded in 1915. The decline of the racetrack after horse betting was criminalized saw the track host auto racing for a few years form 1915-1919, but this too fell out of popular tourism attractions. Coney Island opened not too far away and had a subway connection, also leading to the decline of Sheepshead Bay as a tourist destination. Vacant lots opened, the race track was subdivided for housing and Millionaire’s Row featured bungalows, leading to an influx of permanent residents. The famous automobile track was demolished in 1919, and replaced with housing. 

The channel of Sheepshead Bay waterway was officially dredged by 1916 and in 1922 the New York City Dock Commission dredged the Bay further to expand Emmons Avenue. The City revitalized the neighborhood in the 1930s, with improvements such as the widening of Emmons Avenue and the modernization of buildings by the bay. As Sheepshead Bay became more residential, and people wanted a place to store their boats and spend time with other locals, yacht clubs began to form. The Miramar Yacht Club was founded in 1932 at 3128 Emmons Avenue as the Miramar Boat and Canoe Club. Sheepshead Bay was also home to a maritime training station during the Second World War. The station opened on September 1, 1942 and spanned 76 acres across the Bay, and according to records, around 115,000 servicemen were trained there. The site is now home to Kingsborough Community College. In the 1950s, brick apartment buildings replaced the wooden houses, and by 1960, Sheepshead Bay was the fastest growing community in Brooklyn. 

Over the years, Sheepshead bay transitioned from predominantly Irish and Italian to a more diverse neighborhood. The population increased during the 20th century. Jewish and Soviet immigrants moved to the area in the mid-late 20th century. Avenue U Chinatown is partially in Sheepshead Bay. Albanians, Turks and Hispanics also have high populations in the neighborhood. Development of the neighborhood continued. Today, Sheepshead Bay is mostly residential. High density condos are more common near the center of the neighborhood near Ocean Avenue. The northern shoreline along the bay features piers, an active seafood market, and tour boats. This area also has many restaurants and four branches of the Brooklyn Public Library spread throughout. The New York City Subway has service to the area by the BMT Brighton Line (Trains B and Q).

Zohra Saed is a poet, editor and translator who was born in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and immigrated to Brooklyn with her family as a child in the 1980s. It was comfortable to settle in Sheepshead Bay due to there being many other Turkic people there. She grew up in the close-knit Uzbek-Turkestani community on Ocean Avenue in Sheepshead Bay and roamed Neptune Avenue in Brighton Beach. In an interview for the Coney Island History Project, Zohra reads two of her poems, "Brooklyn" and "Neptune Avenue," which evoke scenes of her childhood. She writes about the place she and her friends used to play between Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay, and her times at the boardwalk along Coney Island. Zohra remembers playing in between the Brighton Beach bungalows, where some of her friends lived. She tells of ghost stories from Lundy’s and how she would dream of horses when she lived in a building where there were once horse races nearby. Sheepshead Bay had many diverse and multicultural spaces such as Russian, Turkish, and later Chinese American. Access to Southern Brooklyn involved access to beaches and getting invited over to other families’ homes. Zohra spoke Farsi, Uzbek, and Arabic before learning English at PS 254, a diverse school where she bonded with teachers and students. She went to Cunningham in Homecrest for junior high school, Sheepshead Bay High School, and Brooklyn College. She has an MFA in poetry from Brooklyn College and a PhD in Literature from the CUNY Grad Center. She also translates poetry from Turkestani and is a Distinguished Lecturer at Macaulay Honors College.
