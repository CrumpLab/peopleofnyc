Buckle your seat belts because on May 26th- May 29th, 2023 it is the BAM-Dance Africa annual theater event. BAM stands for Brooklyn Academy of Music and it is a music school in Brooklyn. What makes the event Dance Africa that they have every year so special is that it is a reunion of all these cultures, Brazil, Ghana, Congo, and more all coming together to share their art and creativity on the dance floor. BAM was founded in 1861 however the Dance Africa event wasn't created until 1977 by a man named Chuck Davis who wanted to shed light on African art, culture, and community.

The man of brilliance, Dr. Charles (Chuck) Davis (1937-2017), was an artist and choreographer of African theater and culture. He studied Africa's art intensively as well as African performers. He was a board member of the North Carolina arts council starting in 1991. During his hard work and talent he earned many doctorate degrees for numerous universities. He is known as “America's Irreplaceable Dance Treasure: The First 100.”

It is often that communities like these get marginalized and are degraded for spreading their culture and claiming their independence. Many do not consider Africa to have high standards or royal means. Well if you can't persuade them, then make some noise…

“AGO! Ladies and Gentlemen please take your seats,” says the musical director. At the current time the musical director is Abdel R. Salaam. Originally Chuck Davis- had a ceremony of him passing off the torch. “AGO!” He says. Every year, about half the side knows the answer and the other half is dead silent. “AME!” The other half of the crowd chants and the main priority of the director is to ensure the show and story runs smoothly so that by he end of the show everyone knows to say “Ame.”

Dance Africa isn't just a show or performance. It is a history lesson from the moment in time that the musical director gives you a crash course on the history of Africa to the minute every dance group returns to the stage and bows. There is no doubt that every single performance isn't a symbolic dance to different cultures in different countries in Africa. Africa is normally centered as one place where the same type of people go- but what they don't know is that the country is vastly united in many different ways which makes it unique and extraordinary.

Different things you will see/hear in this performance will probably be the first narration of the musical director. He will introduce most of the upcoming acts and dances that will go on in the show. The performances usually displayed first will be modern dance, drummers and dancing, and the laddies with the candle. The candle laddies are the most interesting and beautiful performance as they all dress in white and spread across the whole theater including off stage. They dance a specific cultural dance that sends the message of strength, power, and perseverance. After this a few more acts will go on and then there will be a short intermission. People use this time to use the bathroom, buy from vendors, stretch their legs, and etc. Then after the intermission is finished the second half of the show has the more upbeat dances. They feature many Brazilian and Ghanan dances that are loud, fast, and colorful- what a wonderful site to see.

However with traditions and all, this year Dance Africa is themed “Homegrown.” It is said that there will be dance companies invited from the U.S to perform at the annual show. Including some dance companies from New York City such as the Brooklyn and Bronx. This year should be interesting and highly diverse on a more global scale than the previous years. Don't sleep on missing this amazing opportunity.

Finally after every show, it is almost impossible to avoid all the vendors crowding outside selling tins such as delicious food, brilliant African style clothing, shows, and more. The food is diverse selling from all types of food from African countries and its neighboring caribbean cities. Cultural evolution is an interesting site to see so definitely visit if interested. And as always, they always end off. “AGO!” (Listen!) “AME! (I am!)
