This is a Seminar 2 student-written guide to the people and places of New York City. We modeled our guide-book after "A people's guide to New York City" (Mu√±oz, Lewis, & Tumpson Molina, 2022), which also served as our primary textbook for the course. 

We are currently nearing the end of the semester, and this book is under construction until the end of May 2023.
