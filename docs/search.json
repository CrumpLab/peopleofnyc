    "text": "Seminar 2: The People of New York City\nThis is the course website for Seminar 2: The People of New York City, taught by Dr. Matthew Crump in Spring 2023, for the Macaulay Honor’s program at Brooklyn College of CUNY. This website is currently under development\nCatalogue Description: In this seminar, students use tools from the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums and historical and cultural sites across the city.\nCourse Description: In this seminar, students use the tools of the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Seminar topics include: the experiences of Indigenous and enslaved populations; the ongoing consequences of settler colonialism; the ways in which culture, class, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, xenophobia, and racism have shaped New Yorkers’ experiences with and within the city; the formation and social organization of New York’s communities; the impact of successive waves of newcomers to the city on urban culture and politics; and the continuing debates over assimilation, cultural retention, and “Americanization.” Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums, and historical and cultural sites across the city and the use of demographic, population and other quantitative data as well as qualitative approaches. All classes create public-facing final projects, documenting their research and presenting an aspect of New York City’s diversity.\nLearning Goals/Outcomes: Students will:\n\nDemonstrate a comparative understanding of different populations through research and writing about one or more groups or about an area of the city and its shifting population across time.\nUse a variety of approaches (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, or experiential) to studying people in order to come to an understanding of the diversity of people’s experiences in and of the city.\nUnderstand the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and methodologies used by the social sciences.\nIncrease their understanding of past and present issues including colonialism, migration, immigration, race, and ethnicity by analyzing a variety of sources (current, historical, primary, secondary) and by engaging in active discussion about those issues.\nPresent their research to a public audience through a final project that may be completed by small groups or the entire class.\nCritically examine their own roles in and effect on the communities of New York City."

    "text": "It’s been a couple weeks since my last post. The reading for week 2 was the chapter on The Bronx (Bank Muñoz, Lewis, and Molina 2022). The monday class session involved students pairing up in groups of 2 or 3, choosing one site from the reading, and working together to create a 3-minute class presentation about the site for the following Wednesday class. We talked as a class about goals for presentation content and style, and keeping everything within 3 minutes. The Wednesday class involved about 10 presentations, with time after each one for questions and and comments. This was a lively week with excellent participation and presentations.\nThe assignment for week 3 had two components: sign up for a free account at notion.so, then read through the Manhattan chapter and take notes about sites that were interesting and put your notes into notion.\nWhat is notion? A bunch of things. It’s a cloud-based productivity app with many features. It’s really simple to use a text editor. Everything is based on making “pages” that you can put things into, just like any word-processor. It’s possible to put pages within pages, most types of media, and even inline databases. There are many integrations with other web apps. Notion pages can be shared on the internet with a single click. And, it is possible to create teamspaces, where multiple people can work together. Kind of like group editing a google doc, but with a different feature set.\nIt’s now week 4, and the class is moved onto notion. We will likely stay working there for the semester, and then archive our work publicly at the end.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBank Muñoz, Carolina, Penny Lewis, and Emily Tumpson Molina. 2022.

    "text": "This is a retrospective contribution. The blog part of this website was created on February 2nd. The class was held on Wednesday, January, 25th.\nMy goal for the first class was to meet everyone and give some overview of the goals for the course.\nThe room was too small and too hot. We we went around the room introduced ourselves. I asked everyone to share something about what they learned in the first Macaulay seminar, which was focused on Art in NYC.\nI introduced the concept of the final project and described a few different digital technologies we would learn about throughout the course. Some of the tech tools like notion, zotero, and quarto were since added to the compendium. A full description of the final project has not been produced yet, but will become available as the class narrows down on its goals through discussion.\nThe major assignment was to read the introduction of our textbook (Bank Muñoz, Lewis, and Molina 2022) and be prepared to discuss it for next class."

    "text": "Behind the scenes organizational stuff\nThis is my first time teaching Seminar 2. I usually teach cognition and statistics related courses. Another first is using notion.so to organize the course.\nThis course website and blog is being written using quarto, but notion is where most of the planning is happening.\nNotion has a lot to offer, and I’m barely scratching the surface. I have a single document for this course in notion, and this contains all sorts of other notion pages and collected notes. Inline databases are the most useful feature for course organization.\nThe inline database is great for creating a schedule because it has a calendar view making it easy to select individual dates for each class. It’s possible to export the database as markdown and csv, which made it easy to pop into the syllabus.\n\nThe most interesting part is the ability to add notion pages inside pages, and inside of database entries. For example, the entry for January 30th has a notion page, which is showing up on the right-hand side of the screen. This is a useful location to write class notes, announcements, brainstorm possible activities for next class, and generally link organizational material to specific classes. If I end up teaching this class again, I can come back and see what was happening on a class-by-class basis. I liked notion so much that I’m using it to organize all my other classes."

Readings will generally be assigned on Wednesday for discussion on Monday. This gives more days to complete the readings. Wednesday can be some discussion overflow, but mostly for in-class work-shopping.\nThe textbook is one general reading goal for the semester, and there are several others as well that will be provided on blackboard. The non-textbook readings are not yet announced because they are TBD through our class discussions. The advantage is the readings can be responsive to the dynamics of our discussion. The disadvantage is that no one can read ahead if they don’t know what we might read besides the textbook.\nI’m rapidly developing a solution in the form of a shared zotero library. This library will contain all the additional readings, as well as suggested readings, and class researched materials. The zotero library should be available mid-February or earlier."

The groups had 5 minutes to discuss a prompt. After discussion each group leader reported back a summary of the group discussion to the whole class. For the next discussion prompt, the group chose a new leader who would report back to the class. Some of our discussion prompts were:\n\nGet to know each other for 5 minutes (totally unstructured)\nWhat did you find interesting about the reading?\nWhat guidelines should we keep in mind for having productive, mindful and constructive conversations.\nLet’s talk about your reading process. What did you do as you read this chapter? What was your process?\nBased on the reading as a whole, what is/are the purpose(s) of this book?\n\nThe intro had four major sections, and the last discussion prompt was for each group to take one section and discuss it, and then report back. We ran out of time on this one, and took a paragraph-by-paragraph approach in the next class."

I came prepared to moderate this if necessary. I printed out a spreadsheet with everyone’s name and started to check off boxes whenever anyone spoke. My plan was to make sure everyone was contributing as much as possible. I found it difficult to listen and search for boxes to check at the same time, so I stopped tracking this.\nI remember seeing a discussion tracking activity somewhere that could be an alternative. It looked something like this:\nEach person gets a sheet of paper, and as the group has a discussion the members trace lines show who spoke. The paper keeps a record of turn taking. We might try this at some point to see how it lands."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Small businesses are a major component of a healthy and growing economy. Small businesses provide more jobs, careers, and opportunities for people. Their payrolls and taxes are the way that small businesses give back to the community. For the average American, the issue that arises is how to actually start a small business. The amount of beginning capital that is required is astronomical and these people need counseling in how to start, manage, and grow their small business. In addition, the average survival rate for a new firm is two years, and 44% of small businesses fail within two years. Furthermore, 81% fail within ten years. So the question begs, how are people that seek to open a small business supposed to get the help they need to succeed? To provide context to the answer, we will examine a story of a small business owner and how he managed to start and expand his business.\nJesse Camacho grew up in Puerto Rico and settled in the South Bronx. After he got laid off from his sales job, he set up his own shop and continued selling cleaning products by himself. However, he didn’t know where to start in securing contracts with federal agencies and to expand his network. This is when he came across the Small Business Administration. They helped him with the 8(a) Business Development program, and coached him in many areas of business. Now, he has secured many contracts with federal agencies and has ten employees working for him in a thriving business.\nThis is how the Small Business Administration can help small businesses. Created in 1953 by Dwight D. Eisenhower as an independent agency of the federal government, this organization aims to help people plan, launch, manage, and grow their small businesses. They provide counseling services free of charge, business loans, home and disaster loans, and help to win government contracts for small businesses.\nHowever, there are many major issues regarding the Small Business Administration. For one, small businesses are still failing at astronomical rates. That begs the question: is the Small Business Administration really helping small businesses at all? If so many small businesses are failing within a just a couple years of starting out, then maybe the Small Business Administration is not solving the real issues at hand and is just profiting off the interest on the loans and giving these small business owners false hope in that they can cultivate thriving businesses. The other major issue is that in the early days of the pandemic, the Small Business Administration gave out $4.5 billion in grants based on the number of employees working in the business. People lied about the amount of employees they had and claimed so much money from the program. This shows us that the administration really had no idea what they were doing when they were practically handing out money to anyone that accepted it. These are some of the major issues that plague the Small Business Administration to this day, and we hope they can get a handle on it and solve the real issues at play here."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2014, Noëlle Santos, an African-American and Puerto Rican Bronx native, was among many who protested the removal of the only bookstore in the Bronx, Barnes & Noble. Santos was perplexed at the fact that, even though the bookstore’s lease was extended until 2016, that would still mean that the Bronx only had one bookstore. So, she created a plan to start her own bookstore and her love for reading and community guided her entrepreneurial journey over the next few years.\nThe Lit. Bar officially opened on April 27, 2019 (National Indie Bookstore Day) and is situated in Mott Haven, Bronx, lined with a wine bar and curated with an expansive venue of books for Bronx residents. Its graffiti and chandelier aesthetics envelops the atmosphere, a community-building site for residents, as the borough’s only indie bookstore. Outside of the bookstore, “Reach the World, but Touch the Hood First” is written in graffiti, along with a young, Black girl, establishing a prioritization of the community, first and foremost.\nThe blatant disregard for the Bronx and their need for spaces such as this one was tackled by Santos and her business. In its opening week, the store’s contents were almost completely bought out, confirming Santos’ initiative and motivation for beginning this journey in the first place: the Bronx and its desire for literature were being ignored, and a community bookstore was needed.\nIn a neighborhood touched by the growing hands of gentrification, The Lit. Bar reaffirmed the needs of the community before the wants of gentrifiers moved in. However, Santos has received local backlash for “fueling” gentrification. Still, her dedication to her community and the local residents of the Bronx offers an opportunity for local community togetherness, as crowdfunding, local book donations, and community mural decorations have highly contributed to the bookstore’s success.\nSantos feels as her bookstore should not be the only beacon of light for book lovers in the Bronx, and that other models of community and literature accessibility should be sustained in the borough. She states, “We need a used bookstore. We need a children’s bookstore. We need a lending library. We need to support the libraries we already have. There’s room for so many more models.” However, it is important to credit Santos, as she and her unrelenting collaboration with her community serve as a critical model for future endeavors that will hopefully provide local communities with more access to literature, community, (and drinks).\n\n\n\nlit bar.jpeg\n\n\nSources\nGiannotta, Meghan. “The Lit.

It has become one of the most iconic locations in the world of basketball, known for its rich history and its ability to attract the best streetball players in the world. The court has hosted some of the most famous basketball games in history, attracting basketball legends and famous spectators alike. The story of Rucker Park is the story of basketball in America and streetball.\nThe court was originally known as P.S. 156 Playground, but it was renamed in honor of Holcombe Rucker, a local basketball coach who organized tournaments and leagues for young players in the Harlem community. Rucker started the tournaments in the 1950s as a way to keep young people off the streets and engaged in healthy activities. Rucker’s dedication to helping the community made him an admired figure in the basketball culture. The tournaments were wildly popular, and they attracted some of the best streetball players in New York City.\nOver time, the tournaments at Rucker Park became more organized, and the competition became fiercer. The games were known for their high-flying dunks, flashy passes, and intense rivalries. Some of the best players in the world honed their skills at Rucker Park, including Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant. Rucker Park has an intense atmosphere during tournaments.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Rucker Park became a cultural phenomenon. The park was featured in music videos, movies, and TV shows, and it became a symbol of the vibrant and diverse culture of Harlem. The games at Rucker Park became events in their own right, attracting thousands of spectators and inspiring imitators across the country.\nToday, Rucker Park is still a vital part of the basketball world. The park hosts summer tournaments every year, attracting some of the best streetball players in the world. The games are fiercely competitive, and they continue to showcase the best and brightest talents in the sport. Rucker Park is also home to the EBC Rucker Park All-Star Game, which is one of the most prestigious streetball events in the world. The “Entertainer’s Basketball Classic,” which takes place every summer and attracts some of the best streetball players from around the world. The tournament is known for its high-flying dunks, flashy ballhandling, and intense competition, and it has become a must-see event for basketball fans.\nThe history of Rucker Park is a testament to the power of basketball to bring people together and create community. The park has been a cultural touchstone for generations of New Yorkers, and it has helped to shape the game of basketball into the global phenomenon it is today. The legacy of Holcombe Rucker and the players who have graced the courts of Rucker Park lives on, inspiring new generations of basketball players and fans.\nSOURCES\n“Holcombe Rucker Park: NYC Parks.” Accessed May 1, 2023.https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/holcombe-rucker-park.\n“Rucker Park, a Basketball Mecca, Gets New Life - The New York Times.” Accessed May 1, 2023.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/10/sports/basketball/rucker-park-renovation.html.\n“Rucker Park - The Mecca of Basketball.” Accessed May 1, 2023.https://row.oneblockdown.it/blogs/archive/rucker-park-polo-grounds-harlem-new-york-basketball-hip-hop-history."

The learning goals of this course covered a wide range of topics, including the experiences of Indigenous and enslaved populations, the ongoing consequences of settler colonialism, the ways in which culture, class, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, xenophobia, and racism have shaped New Yorkers’ experiences with and within the city, the formation and social organization of New York’s communities, the impact of successive waves of newcomers to the city on urban culture and politics, and the continuing debates over assimilation, cultural retention, and “Americanization.”\nIn the first half of the seminar we read and discussed “A people’s guide to New York City” (Bank Muñoz 2022), along with several additional readings explaining and evaluating research methods in the social sciences. We merged these two sources in the last half of the semester to produce our own guidebook. In this final project, students used the variety of research methods (ethnography, oral history, historiography, archival research, observational research) that we discussed over the semester to write entries into our guidebook. Each student was responsible for writing five entries that allowed them to conduct research to explore our course themes.\nJoin us as we uncover the stories that have shaped the city’s past and continue to shape its future. We invite you to explore the remarkable diversity that thrives within the borders of New York City and appreciate the mosaic of humanity that makes this city truly unique."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 1892, architect Emile Gruwe designed and built Sunset Park’s 68th Precinct as two adjacent buildings. It was an homage to Byzantine and Romanesque Revival style. It had a stable for the police’s horses, three stories, a tower with intricate carvings, and a brick passage. Gruwe wanted the precinct to look so intimidating that “a man about to commit a crime would stand appalled at the sight of a station house such as this.” The building was definitely intimidating, but as the decades passed, it began to fall apart. Over a hundred and forty years after the creation of the precinct, it has become a home for “crime, graffiti, and vandalism.” Much must be done to preserve the building and to repurpose it. As Nikhita Venugopal writes, “Both buildings on the site are vacant and require a complete gut renovation. The two-story building is 5,952 square feet and the three-story building is 14,040 square feet. In addition, there are 14,567 square feet of available air rights, ‘some of which may be utilized on the property,’ the listing said.”\nThe police who worked in the 68th precinct left it in 1970, and no one has inhabited or taken care of the building since. In 1983, New York City designated it as a historic landmark, but that did not help keep the building alive. Today, graffiti covers the building, and inside is much worse. All three stories collapsed. To get to the back of the building from the front entrance, you would have to walk across a ten-foot drop on beams. To get to the roof (which is visible from the main floor), you would have to risk your life by scaling the building’s walls and windows. Fires and general neglect has caused the 68th precinct to sink so low for decades.\nIn 1999, the Brooklyn Chinese-American Association bought the 68th precinct property to restore it into a community center. The Association offers social services from youths to adults. Despite the big dreams, the plans fell through. In 2011, the Landmarks Preservation Commission gave the Association a violation for failing to maintain the building. The 68th precinct then went back on the market for five million dollars.\nThings began to look up in 2016. Yosef Streicher bought the property from the Association. Later, he sold it to the School Construction Authority. The building is now being reconstructed into a new school: P.S. 557. As Ted General writes, “The school will serve 332 students from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade. It will include a gymnasium, rooftop playground, music and reading resource rooms, and a combined cafeteria and auditorium.” Construction began in 2018 and, today, much of the original precinct building has been taken down. From the outside perspective, it is hard to tell the precinct was ever there at all. The construction of P.S. 557 is being welcomed by the community.\nSources on Sunset Park’s 68th Precinct are, at times, conflicting. Some do not agree on who originally built the building or when."

    "text": "Experience magic… Ever seen Netflix’s show Bridgeton? Bridgeton is a show based on history, royalty and standards in areas such as England. However, the show differs in an important way in the fact that it goes against history’s societal standards. If you have ever watched the show you know that there is a white and black cast in the series. This is all addressed by the show due to the king and queens union, a black queen and white king uniting adjacent societies all over England. If you’ve loved the show and like to experience it- the new Bridgeton palace opened in Manhattan just last year. This 19th century based series and all its drama, style, and people is now in action since April of this year.\nTickets to attend the Bridgeton Ball Experience range from $39 to about $80 dollars per person depending on what area of the ball you want to be in. Admission into the crowd is the lowest price while admission to the Queen’s court is more expensive. At the Bridgeton Ball you’ll experience a section of what it is like to live like royalty. Now like any ball you must wear a gown, bonus points if it is a gown from the regency era or earlier. At the ball there will be dancing, cocktails provided, live music, and a few performances. Thanks to the actors in the ball room’s hard work, it truly feels like you are in an actual ball during the 19th century.\nWhen you first step into the ball, that will be your time to mingle. Meet new people or explore with a group of friends- maybe even try to catch the queen’s eye. You’ll want to do this for later if you have admission into the queen’s court.\n(Photo By: Federico Imperiale| Author: Jenna Bernath)\nAn hour or so later, it will be about time for the queen to choose her diamond of the evening. Each of the ladies in court will have a chance to show a first impression to the queen- and whoever the queen chooses in the show was seen as the 1st woman men can come to to marry. In the ball, after the ladies have made an impression it is now time for the second part of the process which is dancing. The queen will observe her ladies in court during these first hours and notice he posture, dress, smile, ability to dance, mingle, etc. If you somehow dazzle the queen during the ballroom dance, she will bring you to the stage and you will become the diamond of the “season.” As the chosen one, you step on stage in the center and silver like confetti rains all over you as the queen’s diamond and everyone cheers and applauds for your achievement.\nAfter the queen’s diamond has been chosen, it is now time to enjoy the rest of the ball for the evening. For the remaining hours there will be lots of live music and performances displaying the love between Bridgeton’s represented relationships such as the Duke and Duchess in season one of the show.\nAnd there you have it. You get all dressed up as a prince, princess, etc to experience the 19th century balls that occurred during the time period. Royal dreams have come true in such a unique and fashionable experience that the Bridgeton Ball Experience brings to many."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Millions of Americans can trace their ancestry back to tenements. Working class tenement residents moved to NYC from other countries or other parts of the country. Their work helped build the city and nation. The Lower East Side has been incredibly diverse since the 1800s. A boom in New York’s population in the mid-to-late 1800s led to the rise of tenement housing on the Lower East Side. Tenements were low-rise buildings with multiple apartments, which were narrow and typically made up of three rooms. Because rents were low, tenement housing was the common choice for new immigrants in New York City. It was common for a family of 10 to live in a 325-square-foot apartment. In addition to affordable housing, many immigrants and migrants came to the Lower East Side for job opportunities in the garment industry. Prior to 1850, German immigrants worked in small garment shops followed by Irish immigrants from 1850-1880. By the turn of the 20th Century, the Lower East Side emerged as both the center of the nation’s garment production, powered by the Jewish and Italian immigrants who now held the jobs in the shops and factories. Successive groups of newcomers would continue to transform the garment industry in the 20th century, including Puerto Rican migrants and Chinese immigrants.\n\n\n\nNYC Lower East Side, Orchard Street, 1898\n\n\nNYC Lower East Side, Orchard Street, 1898\nLower East Side Tenement National Historic Site on 97 Orchard Street is a five-story brick tenement building that was home to an estimated 7,000 people, from over 20 nations, between 1863 and 1935. The structure was contracted by Prussian-born immigrant Lukas Glockner in 1863 and was modified several times to conform with the city’s developing housing laws. When first constructed, it contained 22 apartments and a basement level saloon. Over time, four stoop-level and two basement apartments were converted into commercial retail space, leaving 16 apartments in the building. Modifications occurred over the years.\nFor decades, tenement dwellers had only basic protection from fire but almost none from disease. In the 1860s, diseases like tuberculosis, cholera, and influenza were an urgent fear, and common in New York’s tenements. As public understanding of contagious disease improved, housing laws in 1879 and 1901 helped create change. Around 1890, the landlords at 97 Orchard St. installed windows between the parlor and the kitchen to increase airflow and light, which was believed to help reduce TB outbreaks. The installation also made the space more attractive in a time of competition due to short-term tenement rentals. There was also a move to improve tenements in general. In 1901, a new tenement law required indoor plumbing and gas lighting. In 1934, New York required landlords to replace wooden stairs with brick or masonry. In 1935, rather than continue to modify the building, the landlord of 97 Orchard St. evicted the residents, boarded the upper windows, and sealed the upper floors, leaving only the stoop-level and basement storefronts open for business.\nAs housing codes became stricter, immigration restriction laws were enacted, and upward social mobility occurred, there was a decreased demand for tenement apartments. For more than half a century, 97 Orchard Street apartments fell into ruin, until the Tenement Museum moved in. The Lower East Side Tenement Museum was founded in 1988 by historian Ruth Abram and social activist Anita Jacobson. The two discovered 97 Orchard Street — a dilapidated tenement building that had been shuttered for more than 50 years. Although the building was in ruins, they uncovered personal belongings and other evidence of the families that called those apartments home between the 1860s and 1930s. These artifacts and the families who owned them became the foundation for what the Tenement Museum represents today: a belief that our national identity is best understood and appreciated through the stories of real families whose lives have shaped our shared history.\n\n\n\nMuseum founder, Ruth Abram\n\n\nMuseum founder, Ruth Abram\nThe tenement at 97 Orchard St. appealed to the museum’s founders because the building behind it had been torn down. That allowed street access to the back of the museum and room for a modern external staircase. The museum balances today’s safety demands with preserving the interiors. Some apartments have been left untouched. Others have been recreated to represent specific time periods. The building reflects 19th and early 20th century living conditions and the changing notions of what constitutes acceptable housing. In spite of the restoration, some parts of the upper floors are unstable and closed off. The museum’s exhibits depict the lives of immigrants who lived at 97 Orchard Street from 1869 - 1935. The Museum’s public tours place these lives in the broader context of American history. The Lower East Side neighborhood itself is as much a part of the Museum as are 97 and 103 Orchard Street. Visitors to the Museum can explore the immigrant experience through neighborhood walking tours and apartment tours. The tenement is open for public tours daily.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nAlan Batt, 2006\n\n\nAlan Batt, 2006\nDuring guided tours, visitors can see recreated homes and businesses in the two restored historic tenement buildings. Visitors to the Tenement Museum find hallways, kitchens, and parlors where ordinary families once spent time in. These buildings were home to over 15,000 immigrants from more than 20 nations between 1863 and the turn of the 21st century. A guided tour will offer insight on what life was like then, compared to now. Through the personal stories of immigrant families, visitors can learn about the hard times experienced by immigrants and how they worked to build new lives, and encounter immigration as an essential force in shaping this country. The Tenement Museum is one of the fastest growing cultural institutions in NYC. The museum’s core programming includes more than 12 different tours of 97 Orchard Street and the Lower East Side. In its recently acquired tenement at 103 Orchard Street, the Tenement Museum is recreating the homes of Holocaust survivors, Puerto Rican migrants, and Chinese immigrants. This expansion will enable the Museum to explore the end of the quota system and the nation’s return to its historic ideals in admitting immigrants. The Tenement Museum is an affiliate site of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The museum has an extensive collection of historical archives and provides a variety of educational programs.\nWorks Cited\n“About Us.” Tenement Museum, https://www.tenement.org/about-us/.

The ship was carrying over a thousand people, mostly women and children from the German-American community who were on a church outing.\nThe disaster was a result of a combination of factors, including outdated safety measures and equipment, lack of proper training and inspections, and negligence on the part of the ship’s crew. The lifeboats on board were rotten and unusable, and the life jackets were filled with cork that had disintegrated over time, rendering them useless. The crew was not trained to handle emergencies, and the ship’s owner had not conducted proper safety inspections.\nAs a result of the fire, many passengers were trapped below deck and unable to escape. Others jumped into the river, but many of them could not swim and drowned. The fire burned so intensely that many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. In total, over a thousand people lost their lives in the disaster, the majority of whom were women and children.\nThe disaster had a significant impact on the German-American community, who had been the primary passengers on the ship. The tragedy was felt deeply, and many families were devastated by the loss of loved ones. The disaster led to changes in safety regulations, including stricter inspections and requirements for safety equipment, to prevent similar tragedies in the future.\nCaptain William Van Schaick was the captain of the General Slocum when it caught fire and sank. He was found guilty of criminal negligence in the disaster and sentenced to 10 years in prison. However, he was released after serving less than four years due to good behavior. After his release, he was unable to find work as a captain and worked as a clerk until his death in 1927."

    "text": "The Metropolitan Community Church of New York (MCCNY) is a Christian denomination that caters to and includes queer people in their ministry. The denomination was founded by Reverend Troy Perry in 1968 Los Angeles before expanding to NYC and other cities in the upcoming decade and, today, to thirty-seven countries.\nRev Perry founded the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC) with, according to MCC themselves, “A failed romance[,] An attempted suicide[,] A reconnection with God[,] An unexpected prophecy[,] And the birth of a dream.” MCC began with small services and marches against anti-sodomy laws. In the early years, Rev Perry coordinated with many gay activists in Los Angeles, including (but not limited to) Morris Kight and Bob Humphries. MCC expanded to host the first post-Stonewall march in 1970. The group faced much opposition from Los Angeles police, with Rev Perry himself being beaten by them. But MCC continued and prevailed, spreading their mission and message across the nation. Recently, Rev Perry has been honored through a solo musical comedy in 2011, a tribute at Los Angeles Episcopal Cathedral in 2018, and the Dodgers Community Hero Lifetime Achievement Award in 2021.\nRev Perry’s achievements were became widespread as the MCC grew in Los Angeles. A New York City branch quickly followed and became one of the church’s most influential and successful branches.\nMCCNY was founded in 1972, when it rented space from the Church of the Holy Apostles, led by Reverand Howard Wells. Since then, the church has lived in a 13th street building from 1983 to 1994, then in 446 West 36th street to today. Sylvia Rivera, a notable and highly influential transgender activist during the Stonewall era, was a member of MCCNY. She participated in the church’s food pantry. To honor her, the church named their queer youth shelter Sylvia’s Place. MCCNY campaigned for the Lesbian and Gay Community Center (today known as the LGBT Community Center) and for the general advancement of queer people. The church states their beliefs as:\n“God has created, loves, and includes every person as a unique and wonderful being in the commonwealth of God.\nWe are called to live out our faith through social justice and ministry within and beyond the church.\nPrayer and worship are the focus of community life and the foundation of everything we do.\nThe purpose of queer people and our particular sexualities is to bring the world to right relationship.\nWe are intentionally called to create a spiritual home and safe haven that reflects the diversity of all God’s people. Metropolitan Community Church of New York provides a spiritual home for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community and for all who choose to join us through the practicing of the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship, prayer, social action, education, and fellowship so that all people might experience God’s liberating love, wholeness, and justice; come to live in right relationship with God and all creation; and have the courage to change the world.”\nMCCNY has done much for the queer community since its entrance to New York City. They offer community dinners, a spirituality group for transgender and genderqueer people, a Sunday school for children, a free LGBTQ health clinic, and much more. They have engaging weekly services, with the music ministry performing traditional worship songs and pop songs, such as P!NK’s “Hurts 2B Human.”\nSources\n\nMCCNY Offical Website\nMetropolitan Community Church of New York - NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project\nHow Troy Perry, Metropolitan Community Church Founder, Made LGBTQ History– With God’s Help - Tim Teeman - Jan 26, 2021\nPride in Pictures 2000: Silvia Rivera & our transgender leaders - Ron Johnson - June 14, 2018\nThe MCCNY choir Singing “Hurts 2B Human” by P!NK during the 11am Celebration Service - Metropolitan Community Church of New York - April 5, 2023\nTroy Perry - Wikipedia"

    "text": "Located near the piers lining the Hudson River, Chelsea Market is a retail and dining center that guarantees a good time spent.\nDecades before the Chelsea Market building housed the stores and offices that it does today, it was a factory for the National Biscuit Company (Nabisco). The building was built by the New York Biscuit Company, which was a group of local bakeries that came together in 1890 and built multiple bakery facilities along 10th Avenue. In 1898, the New York Biscuit Company combined with their Chicago-based competitor, the American Biscuit and Manufacturing Company, to create Nabisco. The so-called “Cracker Trust” expanded on these original facilities in the years to follow, adding more facilities until the baking complex took up a full city block. In the 1930s, Nabisco even changed the building structures to make way for a freight train that went through the building, allowing for direct train access.\nThe building is in the heart of the Meatpacking District, which was known for its slaughterhouse and meat facilities. Nabisco even used the lard from the meat packers for their cookies. At first, Nabisco’s main product was the Uneeda Biscuit. The logo for the cookies, the Uneeda Biscuit Boy, still remains painted on the interior brick walls of Chelsea Market. The building is also where Nabisco tested and ultimately created the Oreo cookie, a popular biscuit to this day.\nIn the 1950s, following the decline of the neighborhood, the Nabisco operations moved to New Jersey, where it was less expensive to hold facilities. That, alongside the more expansive space, had a lot of businesses and overall New York City residents move into the New Jersey suburbs.\nThe building’s next owner was developer Irvin Cohen, who paid around 10 million dollars for the foreclosed mortgage. At the time, the Meatpacking District was considered a sketchy neighborhood with little to no prospects, unsafe by all means. Cohen had hopes to create a food center, a dining hall with various restaurants for people to choose from freely.\nChelsea Market opened in 1997. On the ground floor opened a dining concourse, full of local businesses such as The Lobster Place that remain to this day. The dining hall model was majorly successful, helping drive tourism into Chelsea Market and the overall neighborhood.\nToday, the Meatpacking District is now one of the trendiest areas in New York City, full of clubs, high-end stores, and luxury condominiums. These additions to the neighborhood have led and contributed to gentrification, polishing away the rougher history of the area and replacing it with designer boutiques and salons.\nChelsea Market attracts about 6 million visitors annually. The building was purchased by Alphabet (parent company of Google) in 2018 for 2.4 billion dollars. Google’s NYC headquarters sit across the street from Chelsea Market. The ground floor still holds the dining concourse, with various retail stores surrounding it. The basement floors also contain some restaurants, most which are local businesses, and opportunities to shop around. Chelsea Market also hosts a wide variety of events, from art installations to live music to fascinating workshops. With its rich history and landmark in the neighborhood, Chelsea Market has an undeniably immense contribution to its home in the Meatpacking District.\nBalkaran, Makesha. “The Meatpacking District - Living in the Shadow of Gentrification.” Eportfolios@Macaulay, May 4, 2019. https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/alonso2019/2019/05/04/the-meatpacking-district-living-in-the-shadow-of-gentrification/.\nChelsea Market. “Our Story,” n.d. https://www.chelseamarket.com/our-story\nMartinelli, Katherine. “The Factory That Oreos Built.” Smithsonian Magazine, May 21, 2018. https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/factory-oreos-built-180969121/.\nNYC: The Official Guide. “Meatpacking District,” n.d. https://www.nycgo.com/boroughs-neighborhoods/manhattan/meatpacking-district/.\nOttman, Jacquelyn. “Preserving the Historic Meatpacking District By Telling Its Stories.” Chelsea News, October 28, 2022. https://www.chelseanewsny.com/news/preserving-the-historic-meatpacking-district-by-telling-its-stories-BB2254210.\nRosenberg, Jennifer. “A History of the Oreo Cookie.” ThoughtCo., September 13, 2019. https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-the-oreo-cookie-1779206.\nStudios. “Chelsea Market,” n.d. https://studios.com/chelsea-market.html."

    "text": "In 1895, The New York Public Library was founded. It now has over ninety-two locations throughout the city. It was founded because communities have always had the need for free services and resources. Since its founding, The New York Public Library has always stuck with their unwavering dedication to help people get the resources they need. It now holds “more than fifty-six million items, from books, e-books, and DVDs to renowned research collections used by scholars from around the world” (NYPL).\nThe Astor and Lennox Libraries were the prominent libraries in the city before they merged to form The New York Public Library. There were many problems with those libraries which caused them to merge, including financial difficulties and that the books did not circulate between branches. They used to be held up by private philanthropies, until they could not do it anymore and they had to change their mission and merge to create a better system for the people. Now, The New York Public Library could be the system that the people desperately needed.\nThe New York Public Library Central Branch opened on May 23rd, 1911 after sixteen years of planning. Located on 42nd Street and 5th Avenue, it was the “largest marble structure ever built in the United States.” Walk past the stone lions and into the library, you can see cases holding many important manuscripts and things like that. “None of the objects are for sale. But in a way, they already belong to us” (NYT).\nAndrew Carnegie is to thank for the branches of The New York Public Library we have today. In 1901, he donated $5.2 million for construction costs and “donated much of his private collection as well” (Culture Trip).\nThe New York Public Library also hosts many events, including job support, coaching services, and working with other writers. These events are free to the public and geared to help with many of the needs of the community.\nWhether you are in need of a certain book, or you just want to view the original Winnie the Pooh stuffed doll, The New York Public Library has what you need. From the majestic entranceway and lavish design and architecture to the many resources the library has, The New York Public Library is full of the necessities people need."

    "text": "On July 9th, 1819, Rose Butler was executed in what used to be Potter’s Field and now known as Washington Square Park. She was a nineteen-year-old black slave who was convicted of arson after setting her owner’s house on fire and locking them inside, which she admitted was intentional. She was hung for it and this was the last known hanging in Potter’s Field.\nReplacing the gallows, there now sits a fountain in the center of the square. The guilty that were killed by the gallows were buried there and there now rests 20,000 deceased people.\nWashington Square Park—named after the first President of the United State, George Washington—is now a beautiful site to visit and hang out in. People come from all over the city for the playground, chess matches, cemetery, and beautiful grounds. One person, Edith Molina, came from the Bronx to the park and said, “This is the park you come to chill out. In the Bronx, you have gang violence, and police run you out of parks. Here, police don’t do anything.” This shows the disparity between Manhattan and the Bronx.\nThe arch that stands in the park has a history as well. It was built in 1889 out of wood and plaster to commemorate the 100th anniversary of George Washington’s inauguration. After seeing how beautiful it was, the people paid for it to be made out of marble.\nThe park is often the site of protests and riots. For example, after the murder of George Floyd, people protested in the park. They were ignited by the murder and wanted reform to the police in their use of force and violence. Mayor de Blasio supported the police action in the park as they tried to calm people down. Eventually, the police stepped back and allowed the people to protest. There also used to be a curfew in the park, which the police since left behind.\nThe park has gone through many upgrades and improvements as time went on. These include electric and gas fixtures, benches, and roadways and other pavement. In 1871, the Park Department organized outdoor concerts, taking place every Tuesday in the summer.\nOverall, the park is a beautiful place to visit. Whether you’re there for a protest, or just to enjoy the amenities, it is important to keep in mind the long and important history of the park and to be educated on what came before you."

    "section": "",
    "text": "To welcome in the new year, thousands of people head over to Times Square on the night of December 31 to watch the ball drop. Celebrating New Years in Times Square began in 1904, but in 1907, a ball drop at 1 Times Square was added into the celebration. This marked to beginning of the universal symbol the world knows today.\nThe concept of the ball drop began 1883. On top of the royal observatory in Greenwich, England, a time ball was dropped every afternoon at 1. This practice allowed captains of nearby ships to set their chronometers. A chronometer is a device that measure time, similar concept to a modern day watch. After the success in England, time balls spread around the world.\nSince 1907, New York has presented 7 different designs of the ball to welcome in the new year. The first New Years eve ball was 700 pounds! The ball was designed by Jacob Starr, a young immigrant metal worker. The ball measured five feet in diameter; was made of iron and wood; and was covered with one hundred 25 watt bulbs. As the years went on the ball got bigger and brighter. The materials used were up to date with modern technologies. For example, in 2007, the ball was covered with LED technology to replace the light bulbs of the past. So much can happen in a century!\nToday, 2023, the ball is 12 feet in diameter, weighing 11,875 pounds! The ball is covered with 2,688 crystals that vary in size, and illuminated by 32,256 LEDs. The crystals are categorized into 9 groups of 192. Each group represents a spiritual gift such as love, kindness, and happiness. The remaining 960 represent imagination that are cut in a way to reflect one another to mirror the reflections of each other inspiring one another.\nA little after 6pm on New Years eve, the ball is raised up. To watch the event, people gain their spot as they come in. Interestingly enough, many wait early in the morning out in the cold to guarantee a nice viewing angle. Once the clock hits 11:59pm the ball begins to decent as the one minute countdown begins. Once the ball reaches the bottom tons of confetti is thrown out, and people celebrate aloud at Times Square and in their homes.\nannotated bibliography\nNew Year’s Eve 2023 by New Year’s Eve. livestream.com, https://livestream.com/newyearseve/events/10381259?t=1684353383.

    "text": "According to the official Keens Steakhouse website, Keens is the “only survivor of the Herald Square Theater District”. Before becoming a restaurant, Keens just ran as a rendezvous spot for the Lambs Club, a private social club for literary and theater figures. The restaurant itself was established in 1885, independent from the Lambs Club.\nAlbert Keen was the founder of the restaurant, as well as manager of the Lambs Club at the time of the restaurant’s opening. He was a reputable figure in the Herald Square Theater District, both through his restaurant and as a Lambs Club member. Keens Chophouse was right near Garrick Theater; actors would sneak in through the back door (in full costume and makeup) seeking to “fortify themselves” with a quick drink during intermission.\nBesides just actors, Keens was frequented by various playwrights, producers, and journalists for its Pipe Room and churchwarden pipes. The pipes themselves were brought in from the Netherlands, as many as 50,000 every 3 years. Because the clay pipes were too fragile to carry around, a pipe warden registered and maintained the pipes, while pipe boys would move the pipes from storage to their owners and then back into stored safety. The Pipe Club at Keens had over 90,000 members registered. Numerous famous figures regularly visited to smoke at the restaurant, such as Teddy Roosevelt, Babe Ruth, Albert Einstein, and J.P. Morgan. Today, Keens has the largest collection of churchwarden pipes in the world. Many of them are lined up along the ceiling, strapped tight next to one another. More are displayed around the restaurant, especially those from more recognizable names.\nKeens is ultimately part-restaurant, part-museum. The inside of the restaurant is all carved dark wood and historical artifacts collected over the years from its various patrons. It can serve up to 750 customers in a night in its various rooms, each named after a notable figure, whether it be US history or Keens’s. The Lincoln Room, for instance, has various Abraham Lincoln memorabilia. There’s a handwritten version of the Gettysburg Address framed on the wall, but most notably, Keens has the blood-spattered playbill that Lincoln held in his hands the moment of his death. Next to the playbill is an article detailing how the playbill made its way to Keens Steakhouse. Another room in the restaurant is named after Lillie Langtry, a famous actress and paramour to King Edward of England. She sued Keens after being denied access to the gentlemen-only restaurant, eventually winning the case. After the court case, Keens put up a sign saying, “Ladies are in luck, they can dine at Keens.”\nKeens is held in high regard for its high-quality steaks. Its most famous dish are the mutton chops, but it’s far from the only food that Keens serves. Keens stores filet mignon, prime ribs, lamb racks, and short and strip loins in their own dry aging room. The meats are aged for three weeks onsite before being used. The room holds around 20,000 lbs of meat, the number varying more or less depending on the season.\nServing steak since 1885, Keens Steakhouse is a restaurant holding steadfast to its long-held position in a near-entirely changed neighborhood.\nKeens Steakhouse. “History of Keens,” n.d. https://www.keens.com/historyofkeens/.\nKludt, Amanda. “The History of Keens, The 126-Year-Old House of Mutton.” New York Eater, n.d. https://ny.eater.com/2011/7/27/6670601/the-history-of-keens-the-126-year-old-house-of-mutton.\nOlmsted, Larry. “Great American Bites: Keens Steakhouse, NYC’s Oldest, Best,” March 22, 2012. https://abcnews.go.com/Travel/great-american-bites-keens-steakhouse-nycs-oldest-best/story?id=15976470.\nThe Lambs, Inc. “History of the Lambs,” n.d. https://the-lambs.org/history/.\nYoung, Michelle. “On The Wall At Keens Steakhouse, A Blood-Stained Playbill Held By Abraham Lincoln When He Was Assassinated,” n.d. https://untappedcities.com/2020/04/15/on-the-wall-at-keens-steakhouse-a-blood-stained-playbill-held-by-abraham-lincoln-when-he-was-assassinated/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were a couple from New York City who were accused of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Born in 1918, Julius was an engineer and a member of the Communist Party, while Ethel, born in 1915, worked a secretarial job and advocated for worker’s rights.\nThe couple’s involvement in espionage activities started during World War II when Julius was recruited by the Soviet intelligence agency, NKVD. He was tasked with obtaining classified information about the atomic bomb and other military secrets. Ethel soon joined her husband in these activities, and the couple began passing on information to their Soviet handlers.\nIn 1950, the FBI arrested the Rosenbergs and charged them with conspiracy to commit espionage. The trial was highly controversial, with many people believing that the couple was unfairly targeted because of their political beliefs. However, as the case progressed, the prosecution presented evidence that the Rosenbergs had passed on classified information to the Soviet Union, including details about the atomic bomb. Additionally, since then more information has surfaced or been declassified, furthering the case against the Rosenbergs. Even Khrushchev, can be quoted acknowledging the significance of Ethel and Julius’s contributions in his memoir.\nAccording to testimony from Ethel Rosenberg’s brother, David Greenglass, he was recruited by Julius Rosenberg to provide classified information about the atomic bomb. Greenglass was a machinist at the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico, where the atomic bomb was being developed. He passed on sketches and descriptions of the bomb’s design to Julius, who then passed them on to the Soviet Union. Ethel was also implicated in the conspiracy, as she was said to have typed up some of the classified information that Julius passed on to the Soviets.\nWhether Ethel typed up the reports is unclear. Originally, David’s wife, Ruth, was implicated for assisting in pass of information between David and Julius. However, in David’s second testimony he removed all mention of his wife’s involvement by pinning a lot on Ethel. In an interview conducted by Sam Roberts, when asked if his sister was the one who typed up the classified information he responded: “I don’t remember that at all. I frankly think my wife did the typing, but I don’t remember. My wife is more important to me than my sister. Or my mother or my father, O.K.? And she was the mother of my children.” Due to this interview among other indications of Ethel’s minimal role, many believe the charges against Ethel as largely unfounded and unjust.\nDespite protests from around the world, the Rosenbergs were found guilty and sentenced to death. They were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953. While Julius was found dead after the first shock. Ethel’s heart was still beating after the initial 3 shocks and was not found dead until 2 more shocks were administered.\n\nSources\nJenkins, John.

    "text": "Hamilton, the groundbreaking Broadway musical, has transcended the stage to become a cultural phenomenon, leaving an enduring impact on both the theater world and the vibrant city it calls home- New York City. Since its debut in 2015, Lin Manuel Miranda’s masterpiece has revolutionized the way audiences experience live theatre, while simultaneously transforming the cultural landscape of NYC.\nWith its innovative storytelling, diverse cast, and unforgettable music, Hamilton has captured the hearts and minds of audiences worldwide, children and adults alike. Set against the backdrop of America’s founding era, the musical portrays the life and legacy of Alexander. Hamilton through a modern lens, blending hip-hop, R&B, and traditional Broadway melodies. This unique fusion of musical genres, coupled with its captivating narrative, has enchanted audiences, resulting in sold-out shows and unprecedented demand for tickets.\nBeyond its artistic achievements, Hamilton has had a profound impact on the fabric of New York City. The musical’s success has breathed new life into Broadway, drawing a diverse and enthusiastic audience that extends beyond the traditional theatergoers.

    "title": "The Museum of Modern Art",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In the late 1920s, art patrons Lillie P. Bliss, Mary Quinn Sullivan, and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller sought to establish an institution devoted exclusively to modern art. The Museum’s mission began with the vision of its three founders who met on a trip to Egypt in 1928. Bliss was the daughter of a textile manufacturer as well as a collector of modern paintings and prints. Sullivan worked as an art teacher in New York, and although was not a collector of art herself, her husband, Cornelius J. Sullivan, was. Rockefeller, on the other hand, cared deeply for classic and modern art, and shared a “concern for the arts of her own time.” The three banded together to not only continue collecting modern art, but aimed to put it on public display in their newly founded museum. The Museum struggled in a time when “few attempted to collect modern art seriously.” The founders were aware that constructing the MoMA would be a risky venture, but their growing board of trustees, A. Conger Goodyear, Paul Sachs, Frank Crowninshield, and Josephine Boardman Crane, as well as the appointment of Alfred H. Barr Jr. as their director in 1929, proved successful.\nWhen the MoMA first opened on November 7, 1929, the museum was not the institution today’s visitors might expect. At the time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art had the spotlight and did not share it, and it did not feature modern art. When the opening of the MoMA was first announced by the seven collectors and patrons that founded it, the museum was just a few rooms in the Heckscher building, on the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street. The MoMA was officially established “in rented quarters on the twelfth floor of an office building at 730 Fifth Avenue…” and held its first exhibition seven days after opening. Yet this did not make a difference. The public’s response was overwhelmingly enthusiastic. On November 8th, 1929, paintings and prints from the combined collections of the founders were featured in the exhibition Cézanne, Gauguin, Seurat, van Gogh, which attracted about 49,000 visitors to the tight gallery rooms of the museum. The following March, 1,500 people a day visited the museum and the trustees had to start charging admission, which would be 50 cents per person, to better manage the flow of visitors. The MoMA lacked a permanent collection until 1931, as all exhibits featured either pieces from the founders’ collections or from temporary donations from trustees. The founders, starting with Bliss, donated works to the permanent collection and allowed for their paintings to be sold to further fund the MoMA. In the next 10 years, the Museum moved three times into larger temporary quarters. In 1932, the museum moved to a site on 53rd Street, and in 1939 opened the building in midtown Manhattan. Over the years, it would evolve into the building MoMA inhabits today, with six floors of galleries instead of six rooms.\nThe Museum of Modern Art is a comprehensive collection of primarily American and European art ranging from the late 19th century to the present. Its founders dedicated the museum to the most progressive tendencies in modern art. It has an extensive collection of Cubist, Surrealist, and Abstract Expressionist paintings. The museum was one of the first in the United States to include in its collection industrial design, architecture, photography, and motion pictures. The original director Alfred H. Barr Jr. submitted a plan for a multi-departmental structure. Today, these departments include architecture and design, drawings and prints, film, media and performance, painting and sculpture, and photography. The 1939 museum building by Philip Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone was later expanded with an addition designed by Philip Johnson, who also planned the garden in 1953. Expansions took place during the 1950s and 1960s. A major renovation, including a condominium tower and a west wing, doubled the museum’s exhibition space, and was completed in 1984. Continued expansion through enlarging the exhibit space, adding skylights, relocating the main entrance, and building an education and research complex, was designed by Yoshio Taniguchi and completed in 2004. A large expansion also occurred in 2019, with a complete rehang of the collection. The exhibition had formerly been based on chronology, discipline, or region, but this time curators displayed works based on theme and also addressed diversity by integrating more art by women and people of color.\nFrom an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing, The MoMA’s collection has grown to approximately 200,000 works. MoMA also owns approximately two million film stills. The Museum’s Library and Archives contain the leading concentration of research material on modern art in the world, and each of the curatorial departments maintains a study center available to students, scholars, and researchers. MoMA’s Library holds over 320,000 items, including books, artists’ books, periodicals, and extensive individual files on more than 90,000 artists. In addition to gallery talks, lectures, and symposia, the Museum offers special activities for parents, teachers, families, students, preschoolers, bilingual visitors, and people with special needs. In January 2000, the Museum and P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) exercised a Memorandum of Understanding formalizing their affiliation.\nFounded by curator Alanna Heiss, MoMA PS1 (originally known as P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center) was a defining force in the alternative space movement in New York in the 1970s. PS1—a historic 19th century public school building in Long Island City, Queens—has been transformed into a place for artistic experimentation and creativity. Located in what was once a thriving industrial enclave, PS1 has now become a cultural landmark in one of the fastest-growing, urban residential neighborhoods in the country. Decommissioned as a public school in 1963, the building was first secured from the city by the Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc., a non-profit founded by Heiss in 1972 to provide studios and exhibition space in underutilized buildings across New York City. In 1976, PS1 opened with the seminal Rooms exhibition, which was an invitation for artists to transform the building’s spaces with site-specific installations. Over 70 artists activated the campus, which is a tradition that continues to this day with 15 artist interventions across the building. Artists featured in the showrooms were mostly New York artists. Beginning in 1980, PS1 housed the Department of Cultural Affairs’ Materials Donation Program—now known as Materials for the Arts. Since 1982, PS1 has been a member of the City’s Cultural Institutions Group (CIG) in partnership with the Department of Cultural Affairs—the first member focused on contemporary art. To celebrate its affiliation with the Museum of Modern Art in 2000, Greater New York was launched and has taken place every five years since. PS1’s performances, residencies, and events have grown to include more than 3,000 multidisciplinary artists, musicians, scholars, activists, and thinkers to date. In 1997, a campus-wide renovation included the creation of a large outdoor courtyard. Warm Up summer music series (established in 1998) and the Young Architects Program (1999–2019) were launched. Today, The Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 welcome millions of visitors every year.\nThe MoMA was the first museum “in America to integrate twentieth-century fine and applied art” and “has built an unrivaled multi departmental collection while at the same time conducting a coherent and adventurous program of exhibitions and related educational activities.” The MoMA, according to its director in 2004, Glenn D. Lowry, is “predicated on a relatively simple proposition, that the art of our time – modern art – is as vital and important as the art of the past.” As of 2004, “The Museum owns over 6,000 drawings, 50,000 prints and illustrated books, 25,000 photographs, 3,200 paintings and sculptures, 24,000 works of architecture and design, and 20,000 films, videos, and other media works.”"

    "title": "The Settlement House Movement",
    "section": "",
    "text": "After the Civil War, the emancipation of slaves, influx of immigrants, and industrialization spurred more activism in social work. Around the turn of the 1900s, northern cities experienced an influx of immigrants from Europe and a Great Migration of African Americans from the American South. Between the 1880s and 1920s, hundreds of settlement houses were established in American cities in response to European immigration and urban poverty brought about by industrialization and exploitative labor practices. Settlement houses provided support services like education, healthcare, childcare, employment resources, and even offered kindergarten classes before they were offered in many public school districts.\nMany middle-class charity workers thought that poverty was a moral failing. Charities often lumped people into categories of “worthy” or “unworthy” of help. The settlement movement changed popular conceptions about charity and social welfare. They approached the poor from a different perspective, and envisioned not charitable work, but social work.\nToynbee Hall opened in London in 1884, and was the prototype for the settlement house. Stanton Coit lived there for several months, and was inspired by it to open “Neighborhood Guild” in 1886, the first American settlement house on the Lower East Side of New York. In 1889, Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr launched Hull House in Chicago. The Hull House served as a model for over 400 other settlements across the country.\nAddams explained that those with public spirit could use their knowledge of tenants’ rights to help and cooperate with immigrants living in crowded unsanitary tenements who did not know how to reach the board of health. Addams believed in the interdependence of social classes and in the importance of working with and among working class communities. As settlement house residents learned more about their communities, they proposed changes in local government and lobbied for state and federal legislation on social and economic problems.\nLillian Wald was a nurse who taught lessons in a school in the Lower East Side, New York. When she learned of the unsanitary conditions in tenements and the poor health of their inhabitants, she became determined to move to the neighborhood, to live among the poor. With fellow nurse Mary Brewster, she rented an apartment as a place to provide health care to the community, and eventually moved the settlement to a house purchased for her by philanthropist Jacob Schiff. Founded in 1893, this became the Henry Street Settlement.\nJane Addams and Lillian Wald also campaigned against child labor and for public health, sanitation, industrial workplace safety reform, and women’s suffrage. Many settlement houses established during this period are still thriving today.\nDuring the Great Migration, many white-run settlements and other institutions, like the YWCA, refused to serve African Americans. Others served Black families when they lived nearby, but did not do outreach into Black neighborhoods. African American activists, including Ida B. Wells and Elizabeth Lindsay Davis, were the driving forces behind expanding African Americans’ access to social services. These reformers created separate or integrated facilities in African American neighborhoods to help Black migrants adjust from life in the rural South.\nCurrent or former settlement workers helped craft the Social Security Act of 1935 and other reform legislation of Franklin Roosevelt’s administration. The War on Poverty in the 1960s would revive many settlements that closed due to the Great Depression. In 1966 the settlement’s budget was about $100,000, mostly from private sources, but by 2002 its budget was $33,000,000, with 80 percent coming from government sources.\nToday, the settlement house remains one of the primary community-based social-service providers in NYC. Places called “neighborhood house,” “settlement house,” and “community center” are often part of the settlement-house tradition. Settlements today are different from those founded in the 1890s and 1900s—they no longer have workers living as residents, they receive more public than private funding, and they no longer see creating cross-class relationships as central to their mission—but they still reflect the initiative of the settlement-house founders to provide direct services to communities in need."

    "section": "",
    "text": "On November 23, 2023 New York City will showcase its 97th Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. This annual event features giant balloons up in sky, creative floats, marching bands, performers, and performance groups, with thousands of spectators in the sidelines. From 9:00 AM to noon, the parade starts at 77th St and Central Park West and heads down to 34th Street to Macy’s Herald Square. Since 1939, families across the US can experience this wonderful event on the television through the NBC channel.\nIn 1924 Macys opened up an enormous store at Herald Square. The store covers an entire block! To celebrate, on a Thanksgiving morning, Macy’s hosted a “holiday spectacle to alert the masses” (Bryant 1). This event was good to attract shoppers into the new department store, however this was not the thanksgiving parade everyone knows today. This parade was Christmas themed!\nThe big balloons New York sees today where absent in 1924. The parade was significantly small, there where floats themed after Mother Goose characters like little red riding hood, zoo animals marching in the streets, four different marching bands, and Macy employees dressed up as clowns, knights, and cowboys. Despite the small parade, the route was larger than the one today! In 1924 the parade started at 145th street Convent avenue in Harlem and continued to Herald Square, where the Macys store is located. The parade ended with an ornamental float with Santa Claus; once Santa’s float reached the new store a unique showcase played out to attract more guest into the store for the holidays. Three years later, in 1927, Macy’s would host its very first Thanksgiving day parade.\nIn 1927, the animals of the zoo where replaced by balloons, and later iconic cartoon characters. Like all things, the first attempts had issues. There was lots of trail and error, but the idea still remained in play. Balloons would burst, fly away, and get lost. As a response each year safety measure would be updated to the balloons. The balloons began to have the address printed so that they are mailed back to store.\nThroughout its years, the parade continued throughout any economic crisis, however during the events of world war ll, the parade was suspended because rubber and helium were materials needed for the war. After the assassination of president John F, Kennedy there was debate if the parade should be in play, and at the end of the day it happened as a way to lift up the “American spirit”.\nToday, the parade features dozens of balloons, over 30 floats, over a thousand dancers and cheerleaders, over 700 clowns, marching bands from around the country, and a total of over 8000 participants in the parade. The parade ends by welcoming the holidays into the big apple with Santa at the end of the parade.\nAnnotated Bibliography\nDevelopment, Macy’s Interactive. “Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade 2021 - Thanks for Joining Us.” Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, https://www.macys.com/social/parade/lineup/.

    "text": "The New-York Historical Society, located in the Upper West Side across from Central Park, is New York’s first museum. Founded with great self-awareness in 1804 by eleven men who wanted to preserve eyewitness evidence of the events of the American Revolution and British occupation of New York, the museum holds over sixty thousand works and artifacts as well as over 350 thousand books and three million manuscripts in its libraries.\nIts entrance has vaulted ceilings (similar to the one in the Grand Central Terminal Oyster Bar) and columns with interactive touch screens added during its 2011 $65 million renovations to make it less like a vault and more open to public learning. Inside, though, made more visible by such renovations (including making its theater bigger and adding a disability entrance, and exterior changes preservationists enjoy), contains many impressive holdings. These include George Washington’s bed in Valley Forge, the 1863 draft well that set off the Civil War riots, artifacts of activist an tennis player Billie Jean King, a gallery of a hundred Tiffany lamps, and the only surviving New York printing of the Declaration of Independence. Other additions from the renovation include a Fredrick Douglas and Lincoln sculpture on each side of the building, as well as a clock that stopped when the second plane hit during 9/11 in its entrance.\nThough the NY Historical Society has impressive things inside like works of Thomas Cole, Rembrandt, and Audubon (all his Birds of America watercolor drafts), an interactive children’s history museum, and one of the oldest libraries in the nation thats also one of the twenty members of the Independent Libraries Research Foundation, it is important to acknowledge that its building was build by enslaved people. However, it ironically did house the first exhibition on the role of slavery in the city’s economy. The archived exhibition page from 2005 stated, “No place on earth has welcomed human enterprise more warmly. New York was also, paradoxically, the capital of American slavery for more than two centuries.” This is of course exemplified by the nature and history of the museum. Additionally, the society’s role as an independent institution was very important in 1994, as then it had been on the brink of disaster for many years and had almost signed away control of its library and some collection to New York University, which would have violated an agreement with trustees and elected officials to keep independence in exchange for public funding. At the time it was famous for its financial, real-estate, staff, and attendance problems that included closure of the galleries and the resignation of the chairman. However, it was lucky to bounce back due to the help of investments, grants, and fundraising.\n“About Us | New-York Historical Society.” New-York Historical Society, www.nyhistory.org/about.

    "text": "Over twelve million people visit Bryant Park every year, making it one of the world’s busiest public spaces. With all the activities, including games, art, ping pong, putting, reading, and chess, people come from all over the city to stop by Bryant Park.\nWhen the British occupied what is now the United States, they designated specific areas of land for specific purposes. One of those pieces of land is the area of the city we now know as The New York Public Library and Bryant Park. In 1686, this area was to be “public space.”\nFast-forward to the 1930’s, Bryant Park was due for a redesigning. The renovation began with “tearing down the L train tracks and replacing them with a subway stop” (Classic New York History). In addition, the park’s land grade was raised and they surrounded the park with tall hedges. While perfect at the time, these change made Bryant Park a dangerous place a few decades later. Drug dealers, psychiatric patients, and rapes were commonplace at the park. People were terrified of going into the park.\nSomething had to change, and by the 1990’s, a second redevelopment plan was put into place. The first agenda was lowering the park to street level. The tall and thick hedges surrounding the park were torn down as well, making the park visible from the streets. The park was starting to become a place that people frequently visited. The idea was that the more people that visited the park, the safer it will be. So they starting putting more things into place, such as games and events, to make the park more welcoming and open to anyone.\nAnyone can tell you that parks are an important component to the well-being and prosperity of modern society. The point of all these renovations and revitalizations were to make Bryant Park a place that people actually wanted to go to. Furthermore, they wanted to make it a neighborhood people would want to live in.\nThe area surrounding Bryant Park was, and still is, a business district. So it is important to be able to come home to a quiet environment, feeling safe that you will not get mugged.\nPacked into a tight city, it is tough to imagine the idea that there can be a park where you can go for a quiet walk, or a place to play some game sand blow off some steam with friends. And yet, that is exactly what Bryant Park is. If you need a calm place to visit and relax, Bryant Park is the place to go.\nBryant Park NYC.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 1928, the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on Fifth Avenue was sold to the Bethlehem Corporation for $20 million. This building was later demolished, and it was to become the Empire State Building. By 1930, construction began, with plans to make it the world’s first 100+ story building, which was thought to be impossible at the time. It ended up taking a mere 1 year and 45 days to finish construction. To this day, it remains “one of the most distinctive and famous buildings int he United States” (Britannica).\nAt that time, there was a fierce competition to build the tallest building in the world. The Chrysler Building, also in Manhattan, competed and won by 1929. However, by the time the Empire State Building was complete, it over took the Chrysler Building, and became the tallest building in the world, standing at now 1,454 feet high. By 1972, the World Trade Center overtook the Empire State Building as the tallest building in the world.\nGoing back further in history, the area that the Empire State Building now stands was said to be the place where George Washington’s troops retreated to after the Kips Bay battle during the Revolutionary War.\nThe plans for the Empire State Building was made during the roaring twenties, when there was a boom in the economy and an explosion of commercial buildings rose up in Manhattan. However, the roaring twenties would come to an abrupt halt on Black Thursday, when “the stock market crashed, the banks failed, companies went belly-up, and the country would soon be plunged into the Great Depression” (City Signal). The Great Depression did not deter the plans to build the Empire State Building. It even helped the economy, creating 3,439 jobs in a time when unemployment rates were rapidly rising.\nConstruction of the Empire State Building was not all what it is said to be. “Official accounts report that five workers died during the construction of the building” (City Signal), with other accounts reporting even higher numbers. Construction work in the 30’s did not have the same protection and safety equipment that we have today.\nIf you are anywhere near Manhattan, the Empire State Building is a sight worthy of visiting at least once. Public transportation makes it extremely easy to get there, with even a sightseeing bus that makes a stop there. Additionally, there are exhibits and observation decks at the Empire State Building, those requiring a ticket for entry. The observation decks on the 102nd floor give a view of the City only accessible from the Empire State Building. It is a beautiful site to visit and take in."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Earth Matter NYC is an educational 501c3 nonprofit in Governors Island, an island in New York Harbor 800 yards from Lower Manhattan. (Governor’s Island is politically part of Manhattan, though it is geographically closer to Brooklyn.) Established in 2009, Earth Matter is a farm that focuses on circular use of resources as a NYC compost drop off site to reduce organic waste misdirected into landfills which would be used for other processes, such as making fertile soils, rather than causing more waste in transportation to far away sites and increasing methane emissions that exacerbate climate change.\nHowever, a significant function of Earth Matter is education, specifically encouraging community participation and leadership by engaging visitors and volunteers and offering job training through internship and apprenticeship on environmental quality, protection, and beatification. This is achieved mostly though their Compost Learning Center where visitors often tour and see compost-making devices, methods, farm animals, decomposers, and pollinators, and experience the hands-on operation themselves— in addition to a monthly new workshop.\nThrough the Compost Learning Center and other parts of the facility, Earth Matter composts yard waste and 28 thousand pounds/year of food/kitchen scraps from Governors Island as well as participating NYC community members such as the Fulton Stall Market. Also from Governors Island, they compost food vender service-ware as a part of their initiative for a Zero Waste Island in partnership with The Trust For Governors Island. Of this compost, 65 cubic yards were distributed to community gardens (in 2021).\nThe aforementioned other parts of the facility include their Soil Start Farm which teaches gardeners to amend existing soil by using readily available materials to compost. They also have a relaxing lavender field where visitors/volunteers’ pruning gets turned into compost whose creation is financially supported by the sale of the lavender. There’s also the Soil Start Farm’s Heritage Bed Project, which dedicates nine soil beds to Black Southern, Chinese, European Jewish, First Nation, German, Italian, Japanese, LatinX, and Peruvian cultures; as well as their children’s gardening program called Compost Critters Club to promote sustainable habits in kids 2-4 and their caregivers; plus, their donation of produce to the Catholic Worker Soup Kitchen community; and lastly, their growth of local foods for Governors Island food venders.\nAll of these functions of Earth Matter are supported by the technological knowledge built by the growing large community of composters in NYC, and are done in such a way that also conserves to reduce combined sewer overflow, particular industrial wastewater that flood the sewer system. This is important as they’re managing and producing compost from over 500 thousand pounds of diverted organics per year. They’ve indeed gone through some trial and error, like trying different machines and changing them for different uses: for example, a wood chipper is good for breaking down yard waste but not compostable utensils.\nBack to the subject of education and job training, the apprentices and interns are more limited in quantity than the volunteers and visitors of course but are given knowledge enough to build their own compost facility or attract investment for them. On the other hand, volunteers do get to work the composting process, like mixing, aeration, adjusting carbon to nitrogen material ratio, etc. and even can even get eggs from the chickens (who eat food scraps and give manure in return) and a a free small bag of compost (which surprisingly smells nice, I can attest). Lastly, if selected, one can even take a course to receive a certificate as a master composter.\nWorks Cited\nCity Life Org. “Celebrate Earth Day 2023 on Governors Island.” City Life Org, 28 Mar. 2023, thecitylife.org/2023/03/28/celebrate-earth-day-2023-on-governors-island/.\n“Earth Matter NY INC.” GuideStar Profile, www.guidestar.org/profile/27-0625845.

    "text": "New York City marks the beginning of the holiday season at Rockefeller Center with the annual tree lighting ceremony. Having over 50,000 multicolored led lights, decorations, and a 900 pond star topped with approximately 3 million crystals! Such additions allow the bright glow of the massive tree to be visible from a distance within range.\nThe beginning of this tradition occurred in December of 1931, Post Depression era, when workers at Rockefeller Center cooperated to buy a 20 foot Christmas tree. The tree was decorated with lots of household items such as handmade garlands. Later, in 1933, it was decided that Rockefeller center will have an annual Christmas tree lighting ceremony, and in December of the same year, New York City saw the first ever tree lighting ceremony.\nSince then, each year the holiday spirit at Rockefeller Center continues to get bigger and brighter. For example, in celebration of the brand new ice rink, two trees where put up in December of 1936. During World War ll, there was a material shortage so three smaller trees where put up at Rockefeller Center decorated in red, white, and blue. From 1942 to the end of the war the trees were unlit. In December of 1969, the angel figures at channel gardens made its first appearance. These amazing works where sculpted out of metal wire by Valerie Clarebout, an international painter and sculptor. To wrap up the list of events, on December of 1999 the tallest tree was up, standing at 100 feet tall!\nNowadays, on the night of November 30, about 500,000 people visit the Christmas tree ceremony! With opening performances by artist, Christmas carols, and bands, the ceremony is one to be experience at least once. During the month of December the tree is on daily from 5am to 12am, the only exceptions being on Christmas Day in which the lights are on for 24 hours. Another exception is on New Years Eve because the lights are on from 5am to 9pm. Plan accordingly! To get the most of the holiday spirit plan a visit to the Radio City Rockettes’s Christmas spectacular or the 12 angels at channel gardens. The large variety of shops at Rockefeller Center allow people to do some holiday shopping as well! and if hungry, Rockefeller Center has over 30 dinning options to choose from.\nThe holiday spirit does not stop once the tree lights go down. When the holiday season is over the tree is donated to Habitat for humanity, a non profit housing organization. The organization partners up with families and individuals to build and improve affordable homes. Since 2007 the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is made into lumber for habitat homes. When the tree is taken down, it gets cut down into large pieces and then transported to a mill in New Jersey to make the wood have the appropriate shape for construction.\nRemember the tree is free to visit for the whole month of December!\nBibliography\n🎄 Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree Lighting | NYC Winter Events. https://www.rockefellercenter.com/holidays/rockefeller-center-christmas-tree-lighting/#viewing-details.

    "text": "Chai, or cha, plays a prominent role in South Asian culture and society. From drinking it with siblings for breakfast on a Sunday morning or serving it to first-time guests, it symbolizes familiarity, kindness, respect, and hospitality. In fact, it provided an avenue for connection and dialogue between two people from different cultures, whose families struggled to connect with each other due to long-established prejudice and biases. In short, it laid the foundation of a union between two people and families, a means of overcoming social challenges and reaching a point of interconnection.\nKhalida Brohi, a Pakistani activist, founded The Chai Spot with her husband, David Barron in Sedona, Arizona, before establishing a second location in Manhattan, New York. Brohi’s cousin was killed in an honor killing in Pakistan, an event that altered the course of her life, kickstarting the beginning of her activism and fight to provide the women of Pakistan with leadership, financial, and educational opportunities. From joining WAKE UP, an international organization dedicated to ending domestic violence, to creating the Youth and Gender Development Program (YGDP), to launching Sughar, a nonprofit organization that provides Pakistani women with economic opportunities, she finally founded The Chai Spot (which is just as political as her last endeavors).\nThe Chai Spot’s interior is covered with beautiful, colorful, and unique Pakistani art, Kashmiri rugs, sofas, and pillows, creating a cozy atmosphere for those who enter. From traditional cardamom chai to iced dirty chai, the establishment offers a multitude of chai and South Asian snacks such as samosas, to introduce people to the culture while also bringing a piece of home to those who need it.\nThe Chai Spot also creates opportunities for villages in Pakistan, namely the Balochistan region, where Brohi is from. The art surrounding the interior (and that The Chai Spot is known for) is handcrafted by Pakistani artisans, who are paid for their work and labor. It also provides the women of rural Pakistan with grants to begin small businesses, encouraging and paving the way for financial independence and stability for Pakistani women, something that is not necessarily prioritized otherwise. Additionally, through The Chai Spot, Brohi and her husband have been able to open schools in Pakistan, educating about 150 children annually in Balochistan and 40 children in Kotri, Sindh.\nThe Chai Spot not only satisfies one’s tastebuds and provides Instagram-worthy photos, but it also significantly changes the lives of women and children in Pakistan – so give it a visit.\n\n\n\nchai spot.webp\n\n\nSources\nAli, Salman. “‘Seeing My Cousin Murdered in the Name of Honour Required a Strong Response.’” Daily Times, 21 June 2018, dailytimes.com.pk/256044/seeing-my-cousin-murdered-in-the-name-of-honour-required-a-strong-response/.\nBrohi, Khalida (October 2014). “How I Work to Protect Women From Honor Killings”.

It was on October 28, 1929, the day before the Wall Street crash that real estate developer John R. Todd hired architects to start building Rockefeller Center. L. The designers were Andrew Reinhard and Henry Hofmeister. In January 1930, these gentlemen proposed an initial design which they sadly had not agreed upon until 1932. As the population was not in a position to afford initial rental of some buildings, due to the financial depression. This development did not look like it would achieve any promising future under such depressing conditions for unemployment. However, Rockefeller wanted to stand out and be able to help both the economy and the people. On July 22nd, 1931, when construction of the structure began, New York’s economy was in a horrendous. Unemployment rates for construction workers were extremely high when building began, and many business they went bankrupt. One of New York City’s most recognized landmarks is Rockefeller Center, which is also where the Today program and Saturday Night Live are filmed and where ice skaters circle an ice rink surrounded by hundreds of different flags from around the world. This shows that the Rockefeller center is full or art and also CULTURE. The complex is extremely complex and spacious. Rockefeller Center is “the city inside a city,” The Rockefeller Center is where, every year, the famous Christmas tree lights up in this city. As it seemed to glide over the flooded plaza in front of a white granite background, an orchestra of water jets was accompanying its sculpture. Rockefeller Center would be decorated for Christmas every year by a Norway spruce that had soared to the height of 100 feet in 1948. German artist Michael Hammers’ nine-and-a-half-foot star, which contains “25,000 crystals and a million facets”, has been the tree’s crowning ornament since 2009. publicist decided to establish the Christmas tree as a yearly custom in 1933 after being moved by the first tree. To finalize, despite these hard times, it was a representation of America’s perseverance."

On campus various events are held by the many clubs that Macaulay has, allowing for students to attend and wind down after the stress and busywork of their classes.\nBesides the physical location of the college, Macaulay offers a financial aid program in the form of an Honors Program across eight separate CUNY colleges, these being Baruch College, Brooklyn College, City College, College of Staten Island, Hunter College, John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Lehman College, and Queens College\nStudents are given full year tuition for four years at a campus of their choice. In order to be accepted into this program, however, a lot needs to be considered.\n“Admissions to the The Macaulay Honors College will be based upon\n\nHigh school grades\nSAT I/ACT scores\nAn essay\nRecommendations\nIn some cases an interview\n\nTo continue to receive the The Macaulay Honors College financial package students must remain in good academic standing as defined by the The Macaulay Honors College.” (CUNY Macaulay Honors Program)\nStudents are also offered study grants in order to further go into their research.\nWith all these perks offered by the main college, you would think that being in the Macaulay Honors Program is easy. One thing you’re told about before you start your first semester in the program is the various requirements you must be extremely diligent about. During your four years in the program, students must complete the various pathways at the student’s campus. They are required to finish at least 30 hours of community service before junior year, recommended about 10 hours per year. These specific requirements are detailed on the Macaulay website. Students are also asked to work at an internship or study abroad.\nAs a student in the Macaulay program, the work has been difficult. As it is my first year, it is still relatively manageable, with the only Macaulay related work I’ve done so far is take the seminars and do a lot of community service on my spare time, on top of keeping my GPA in a good place. Macaulay students also get to work with advisors that are assigned to them. You’re required at least one meeting per semester, just as a way to update your advisors and prepare for the next semester, as well as the inevitable final thesis that is written in the senior year.\nThe Macaulay Honors Program is a challenge, but the engaging work done with peers and the freedom that is offered in the seminar classes allows for proper growth for the student. Depending on the professor, students will get time to explore sites off campus to write about in the various assignments for class. It makes for a lot of great opportunities that you would not otherwise have access to.\nSources:\nMacaulay Honors College\nWilliam E.

Where else would you go to see this but the One World Trade Center. The 102nd floor of the 1,776 foot building lies the One World Observatory. The site was first opened on May 29 in 2015, attracting tourists far and wide and garnering immense support.\nIt was in New York City’s Financial District where the Twin Towers once stood. However, after the tragic attacks on 9/11 resulted in the destruction of the towers, designs started to come up for what would stand in their place. Four years later, “a project was presented by architect David Childs called ‘Freedom Tower’ and was finally accepted.” (Memo). Once construction started in 2006, it would take another 7 years for the Freedom Tower to reach completion, being done so on May 10 2013. The building was still closed to the public at this point, though it only took another two years for the general public to be allowed into the now One World Trade Center.\nOther information from Pars Memo, a tourist who went multiple times to the site, include:\n– It measures 546 meters high (1776 feet), which corresponds precisely to the year of the Declaration of Independence of the United States.\n– It is the tallest building in North America.\n– If we remove the antenna, measuring 129 meters (almost ¼ of tower height), it would be the second tallest building after the “Willis Tower” in Chicago that measures 527 meters with 110 floors.\n– It has 104 stories.\n– The observatory is on floors 100, 101, and 102.\n– The building has 73 elevators, but only five are used for the OWO (One World Observatory). The other lifts are used for security and office employee’s floors 19 to 100.\n– The estimated cost is 3.9 billion dollars.\nAnyone interested in booking a trip to the observatory should do so in advance, as lines can get pretty long. Although according to most who go, the trip is worth it, as a complete 360 degree view of the city from that height is a sight to behold.\nSources:\nOne World Observatory | Manhattan, NY | Attractions in Financial District, New York\nDiscover the One World Observatory"

    "title": "Central Park",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At the beginning of 1858 a park called Central Park situated in New York Manhattan was created. Central park is considered a world-famous public park, because the park addresses the recreational needs of the rapidly growing City. The main and original purpose of the park was to make the citizens that came from the countryside and that moved to New York feel closer to the countryside. Also, to incorporate nature so New Yorkers would have an escape from the city, buildings and suburbs. Over 150 years later, the Park still provides this essential purpose, and welcomes all visitors, while accommodating newer forms of recreational activities. Central Park is one of the most visited urban parks in the country and one of the most popular destinations in New York City.\nYou might ask yourself, who’s idea was to create Central Park and how did it happen? Well, In the 1800s, New Yorkers were highly influenced by the parks around the world and thus declared a competition for the designing of a recreation park. An existing village and farmland that was inhabited by Irish immigrants and African Americans, was chosen as the most apparent site for the landscaping. Something really fantastic about Central Park is that the park was the first public park in the United States. The two winners of the competition mentioned before were the British-American architect Calvert Vaux and Landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted. Frederick Law came from Staten Island and got a pot of land. The park became accessible to all the citizens of New York, and not just the privileged. This public park would offer families an attractive setting for carriage rides and provide working-class New Yorkers with a healthy alternative to the saloon. After three years of debate over the park site and cost, in 1853 the state legislature authorized the City of New York to use the power of eminent domain to acquire more than 700 acres of land in the center of Manhattan. An interesting fact about the construction of the park is that Central Park was one of nineteenth-century New York’s most massive public works projects. Some 20,000 workers–Yankee engineers, Irish laborers, German gardeners, and native-born stonecutters–reshaped the site’s topography to create the pastoral landscape.\nCentral park is not just a turistic, important landmark or beautiful place to hang out with your friends and families but also a huge contribution to the community and environment of New York City. How does it help the environment and community? Well as you might know the Park’s trees not only decrease carbon dioxide levels, but also help cool the area during increasingly common heat waves that are exacerbated by the climate crisis. Metropolitan areas like New York City are often hotter than surrounding rural areas due to heat-absorbing materials like concrete and glass. Trees work as natural air conditioners, not only providing shade for the people sitting under them, but cooling the city as a whole. These trees also absorb water that evaporates in the heat, cooling the air temperatures around them.\nWork Cited\nHistory of Central Park - Central Park. https://centralpark.org/history-of-central-park/.

    "text": "The vessel\nThe most remarkable feature of Hudson Yards is the curving stairway, which represents a new building. This interactive installation, which will allow visitors to explore a number of different perspectives on the town and its inhabitants, is designed by Heatherwick Studio in collaboration with Thomas Heatherwick. Vertical ascent offers an unbelievable view of the city, river and beyond in 154 intricate stair walks comprising 2,500 linear steps around and 80 landings. The vessel’s got an English heritage here in New York City, which is just about everything else. It was created by an English architect named Thomas Heatherwick, whose various groundbreaking projects in London have transformed the city. In his own work, he combines the vision of creativity with realworld applicability. In fact, the Vessel is not actually The Vessel at this point in time. Until they can come up with something better, the Vessel is just a name that’s been thrown around. The creators of the building hope that people are going to love it and name it after them. The Vessel, as it is now known, is an interactive art installation with a network of steps and landings, and visitors can walk or use an elevator to the top. Hollywood style. The Vessel story is a tale of how it’s finished. The designer had done his best to conceal the design. So much that a barrier of 20 feet was built in northwest Italy to block public access to the steelworks from which the vessel’s skeleton had been constructed. A part of it was taken to the U.S. in a tugboat on the Hudson river near New York City, heading for its construction site. The Vessel’s been on pause a few times since its inception. The ship was shut down for social isolation as the outbreak of coronavirus reached its peak. Between 2019 and May 2021, around three people killed themselves by jumping off the vessel. By introducing security measures, the vessel was allowed to remain open to the public while not being destroyed. After all this, the workers have received training on how to recognize warning signals of someone considering harming themselves. The entries shall be entered in pairs or groups. Although there were more protections in place, a fourth suicide happened in July 2021. After this suicide the ship’s been closed for a long time. Therefore, according to a lot of people, the barriers of the vessel ought to be raised or destroyed. At Hudson Yards, the Vessel is a center of attention.

    "text": "Park Avenue is a world-renowned street in Manhattan, New York City. The avenue is home to some of the most luxurious and prestigious buildings, hotels, and businesses in New York. Park Avenue is split into four sections by the Grand Central Terminal, which serves as a major transportation hub for commuters in the city. One of the most notable features of Park Avenue is the stunning array of architecture on display. The buildings along the avenue range from pre-war to modern, and the styles vary from neo-Gothic to Art Deco. One of the most iconic structures on the avenue is the MetLife Building, formerly known as the Pan Am Building. It is a prominent fixture on the New York City skyline and has been shown in countless movies and television shows. Another notable building is the Seagram Building, a modernist skyscraper designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. Park Avenue is also home to many of the world’s most luxurious hotels. The Waldorf Astoria, for example, is a legendary hotel that has hosted numerous celebrities and dignitaries over the years. The hotel’s opulent design and grandeur have made it a favorite among the rich and famous. The St. Regis is another iconic hotel on Park Avenue known for its luxurious amenities and impeccable service.\nHowever, the people who own places in this area are there for the purpose of gaining power. Not only do the people at the top gain political power using their wealth, but they also create a big gap between regular civilians. The people who own the expensive apartments own most of the capital of the U.S. The wealthy are considered the 1% and they overwhelm millions of people when it comes to income growth. Also, the wealth distribution in 2010 was 400 of the richest people equaled the income of 150 million people in the U.S.\nPark Avenue: Money, Power and the American Dream⎜WHY POVERTY?⎜(Documentary).

    "text": "Times Square, located in the heart of New York City, is a vibrant and iconic destination that embodies the spirit and energy of the Big Apple. With its dazzling billboards, bustling crowds, and neon lights, Times Square is a renowned symbol of entertainment and commercialism. This world-famous intersection, featured in numerous films and television shows, has a rich history that dates back to the early 20th century.\nFormerly known as Longacre Square, this area gained prominence when The New York Times relocated its headquarters there in 1904. The newspaper’s presence resulted in the square’s renaming to Times Square. By the 1920s, the Great White Way had emerged as a prominent theater district, captivating audiences with dazzling marquees and attracting renowned stars to its stages. However, the area soon faced a decline in the mid-20th century as the rise of television and the effects of World War II took their toll. Times Square became synonymous with urban decay and crime, prompting a cleanup campaign in the 1980s that aimed to revitalize the district. Today, Times Square is a thriving hub of activity, attracting tourists from around the globe who come to witness the spectacle of Broadway shows.\nMassive electronic billboards flash advertisements for Broadway shows, the latest blockbuster movies, and renowned brands, creating an electrifying atmosphere. The neon lights illuminate the streets, transforming the square into a nocturnal wonderland that never sleeps.\nOne of the most striking features of Times Square is its incredible crowd density. People from all walks of life converge here, their diversity evident in the different languages, accents, and fashion styles that fill the air. Locals and tourists alike are drawn to this cultural melting pot, seeking the unique experiences it offers. As the masses move through the square, street performers captivate audiences with their music, dance, and extraordinary talents.\nAs people look upwards, you are met with the crazy sight of towering skyscrapers that define the New York City skyline. Among them, the iconic One Times Square stands tall, adorned with the world-famous New Year’s Eve ball, which descends each year, marking the transition into a new beginning. The surrounding buildings house renowned theaters, luxury hotels, flagship stores, and dining options, making Times Square a hub of entertainment, shopping, and culinary delights.\nIn addition to its commercial and entertainment offerings, Times Square serves as a hub for cultural events and celebrations. From the annual New Year’s Eve celebration, where millions gather to witness the descending ball and the eruption of confetti, to parades honoring different cultures and holidays, the square is a constant stage for lively festivities. It is a place where people come together to share in the joyous spirit of the city, celebrating life, diversity, and the pursuit of dreams.\n“Times Square | Location, Description, History, & Facts | Britannica,” May 17, 2023. https://www.britannica.com/topic/Times-Square.\nadmin. “History of Times Square.” Text, May 17, 2017. https://www.timessquarenyc.org/history-of-times-square."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Make the Road New York (MRNY), or Se Hace Camino Nueva York, is an immigrant-led grassroots organization that mobilizes Latine, Black, and immigrant groups in New York. Created in 2007, MRNY was actually a merger organization of Make the Road by Walking (MRBW) and the Latin American Integration Center (LAIC). MRBW was founded in 1997 by low-income Bushwick, Brooklyn residents of color. The organization pushed for community organizing and leadership. The LAIC was founded in 1992, in Jackson Heights, Queens, equipping Latin American immigrants with education, citizenship support, and community.\nMRNY holds centers in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and Westchester County for each region and its immigrant population. It offers many programs, designed to address the specific needs of immigrant community members: Adult Literacy, Civic Engagement, Community Organizing, Health Access, Leadership Development, Legal Services, and Youth Power Project & School Programs. The organization strives to provide the community with educational skills, knowledge of their rights, and leadership skills, in order for them to vote, file legal complaints, and organize within their community. From addressing the needs of children and teenagers to supporting the older members of the community, MRNY works to provide all members with the knowledge and skills necessary to fight for their rights as a collective.\nMRNY has made immense progress in legal matters, as it filed a complaint with the Commission on Human Rights against the NYPD’s 110th precinct on the basis of profiling and discrimination. As policing is an especially urgent matter in communities of color in New York City, and Black and brown people are targeted by NYPD, the organization works to educate young members about their rights. They have even advocated for the passage of the Community Safety Act, decreasing stop-and-frisk rates in New York City. Additionally, MRNY represents numerous DACA recipients in a lawsuit against Donald Trump’s presidential administration’s cessation of the DACA program, such as Martín Batalla Vidal, an immigrant from Mexico. MRNY has also been involved in the passage of the New York Dream Act in 2019.\nFrom its conception to its expansion into other boroughs (and even counties in the state), MRNY has worked immensely to provide its community members with the tools necessary to address injustice and discrimination. With an accessible website that holds all the necessary information, guides, news stories, and programs to stay informed and educated about one’s rights and opportunities to work toward justice and social change, MRNY is tirelessly making history as an organization of immigrant community members for immigrant community members.\n\n\n\nmrny.jpg\n\n\nSources:\nAmin, Reema. “New York Legislators Pass Dream Act.” Chalkbeat New York, 23 Jan. 2019, ny.chalkbeat.org/2019/1/23/21106651/new-york-legislators-pass-dream-act.\nBobo, Kimberley A.; Pabellón, Marien Casillas (2016).

    "text": "Situated in Red Hook Brooklyn, Pioneer Works is a nonprofit organization and cultural center that encourages artistic and scientific freedom, while advocating for inclusion and diversity. It offers itself as a free space for artists and scientists, equipping them with free tools to use and exchange ideas to form new models of thinking. Founded by artist Dustin Yellin, Pioneer Works prioritizes community building through interactive processes and educational classes among artists and scientists, a space in which different thinkers can work in collaboration.\nThe building that houses Pioneer Works was formerly named Pioneer Iron Works (which also inspired the establishment to form the name). The organization states that their, “adaptive reuse of the site represents the organization’s commitment to sustainability and the preservation of historic spaces.” Dedicated to their mission, their origin was also grounded in their cause and belief; maintaining the spirit and cultural/historical significance of the site while also restoring it and adapting the site for Pioneer Works’ mission and purpose.\nFrom “Dynasty Handbag: Titanic Depression” to “3 Women, On Women: Merve Emre, Sigrid Nunez, and Doreen St. Félix on Susan Sontag Now,” the center offers art exhibitions and programs that incorporate different mediums to produce multimedia events that offer social and political commentary in various forms. In addition to art exhibitions, the center also houses a music studio, a bar and restaurant that run during events, and a garden. Pioneer Works also offers a virtual version of their center, “Broadcast,” which tackles everything from music to Indigenous works, to contemplative existential questions, in the form of audio, articles, and video. Yellin was driven to create a space that advocates for and actively contributes to the convergence of ideas and mediums. He states, “It’s something I’ve always wanted to do, and it’s something I’ve always been doing, in a very organic form… this just brings the organic artist space, or atelier, to an institutional level.”\nAlthough the organization has worked with nonprofits that address the increasing levels of gentrification of Red Hook and public schools in the area, it is still critical to assess the level of gentrification that the organization has brought it. An unnamed nonprofit leader has commented on how Pioneer Works’ existence has “attracted a certain clientele of white hipsters,” and that one of the city’s largest public housing projects sits just a few blocks from the Pioneer Works building. Pioneer Works’ existence, along with its mission, purpose, and role in gentrification introduces a question to grapple with – how should society handle two truths that seem to exist simultaneously?\n\n\n\npioneer.webp\n\n\nSources\nFabricant, Annie. “Dustin Yellin - on Building 12-Ton Sculptures and a ‘utopian Art Center’ in Brooklyn.” HuffPost, 7 Dec. 2017, www.huffpost.com/entry/dustin-yellin-art-space_b_1242701.\nFriedman, Gabe. “Pioneers at Work.” Brooklyn Magazine, 4 Oct. 2022, www.bkmag.com/2022/09/22/pioneer-works-at-10/.\nLipinski, Jed. “An Artist’s Big, Big Plans for Red Hook.” The New York Times, 13 Jan. 2012, www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/nyregion/the-artist-dustin-yellins-big-big-plans-for-red-hook.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0.\nhttps://pioneerworks.org/"

    "text": "Hungry and looking for outdoor foods and treats? Hop on down to Smorgasburg and fill those tummies! Smorgasburg is a conjoined food market of different vendors that provide meals, drinks, and desserts. They are opened once a week and have three different locations, one in Prospect Park (Sundays), Williamsburg(Saturdays), and on Fulton Street/Church Avenue-World Trade Center(Fridays).\nThe idea of Smorgasburg was created in 2011 from the idea of community farmer’s markets. It has now grown into a huge network of vendors selling their outdoor food items and has locations all throughout New York City.\nIn prospect park, expect to see a whole lot of tents and a whole lot of people. Enter your first Sunday on a warm sunny day. You see dozens of tents and wonder what to choose. Then you stand online to see that the line is relatively short and moving quickly. This is because with Prospect Park’s 80+ vendors there are many options at your disposal. Try everything, within reason of budget of course. Every tried lamb on stick? Head on down to D’Abruzzo for a selection of chicken, beef, lamp, or a mix of all three of your kabobs. Just want a burger? Head on over to Burger Supreme for a delicious meal.\nEnjoy nature along with your meal. Prices vary from vendor to vendor, but when buying such delicious foods, start with something small, then a meal, and then get something to take home.

One classic favorite is the vendor market known as Bunan. This is a Haitian restaurant that sells different style foods than most Haitian restaurants. They offer in total three different types of meals, the plantain sandwich, sweet plantain boats, or plantain chip nachos. The most classic meal is the Plantain Sandwich which has a bread-like topping of two fried plantains. With any meal you get, you then have a choice to choose your meats. For this they have Griot pork, jerk chicken, mushroom, red snapper, or slider plantains. The price will vary depending on the meat you choose. And last but certainly not least comes the toppings. In the topping they offer caramelized onions, red cabbage slaw, pkliz (shredded carrots, onions, and peppers), and a secret sauce. You can top this off with one of the few drinks they have to offer such as the passion fruit lemonade that comes with your dense meal.\nAnother cultural style food you might want to try is Brazilian. Petisco Barzuca is a Brazilian vendor at the event that sells Brazilian-like snacks or appetizers at their shops. This is a great option when you prefer to try something unique but however don’t want to get too full on your journey fast. They sell a variety of different Brazilian based appetizers/ snacks. The popular ones they sell are the chicken and beef empanadas and the fried churros stuffed with caramel sauce.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Buckle your seat belts because on May 26th- May 29th, 2023 it is the BAM-Dance Africa annual theater event. BAM stands for Brooklyn Academy of Music and it is a music school in Brooklyn. What makes the event Dance Africa that they have every year so special is that it is a reunion of all these cultures, Brazil, Ghana, Congo, and more all coming together to share their art and creativity on the dance floor. BAM was founded in 1861 however the Dance Africa event wasn’t created until 1977 by a man named Chuck Davis who wanted to shed light on African art, culture, and community.\nThe man of brilliance, Dr. Charles (Chuck) Davis (1937-2017), was an artist and choreographer of African theater and culture. He studied Africa’s art intensively as well as African performers. He was a board member of the North Carolina arts council starting in 1991. During his hard work and talent he earned many doctorate degrees for numerous universities. He is known as “America’s Irreplaceable Dance Treasure: The First 100.”\nIt is often that communities like these get marginalized and are degraded for spreading their culture and claiming their independence. Many do not consider Africa to have high standards or royal means. Well if you can’t persuade them, then make some noise…\n“AGO! Ladies and Gentlemen please take your seats,” says the musical director. At the current time the musical director is Abdel R. Salaam. Originally Chuck Davis- had a ceremony of him passing off the torch. “AGO!” He says. Every year, about half the side knows the answer and the other half is dead silent. “AME!” The other half of the crowd chants and the main priority of the director is to ensure the show and story runs smoothly so that by he end of the show everyone knows to say “Ame.”\nAsase Yaa African American Dance Theater Photo: Supplied/BAM | Author: C. Zawadi Morris\nDance Africa isn’t just a show or performance. It is a history lesson from the moment in time that the musical director gives you a crash course on the history of Africa to the minute every dance group returns to the stage and bows. There is no doubt that every single performance isn’t a symbolic dance to different cultures in different countries in Africa. Africa is normally centered as one place where the same type of people go- but what they don’t know is that the country is vastly united in many different ways which makes it unique and extraordinary.\nDifferent things you will see/hear in this performance will probably be the first narration of the musical director. He will introduce most of the upcoming acts and dances that will go on in the show. The performances usually displayed first will be modern dance, drummers and dancing, and the laddies with the candle. The candle laddies are the most interesting and beautiful performance as they all dress in white and spread across the whole theater including off stage. They dance a specific cultural dance that sends the message of strength, power, and perseverance. After this a few more acts will go on and then there will be a short intermission. People use this time to use the bathroom, buy from vendors, stretch their legs, and etc. Then after the intermission is finished the second half of the show has the more upbeat dances. They feature many Brazilian and Ghanan dances that are loud, fast, and colorful- what a wonderful site to see.\nHowever with traditions and all, this year Dance Africa is themed “Homegrown.” It is said that there will be dance companies invited from the U.S to perform at the annual show. Including some dance companies from New York City such as the Brooklyn and Bronx. This year should be interesting and highly diverse on a more global scale than the previous years. Don’t sleep on missing this amazing opportunity.\nFinally after every show, it is almost impossible to avoid all the vendors crowding outside selling tins such as delicious food, brilliant African style clothing, shows, and more. The food is diverse selling from all types of food from African countries and its neighboring caribbean cities. Cultural evolution is an interesting site to see so definitely visit if interested. And as always, they always end off. “AGO!” (Listen!) “AME! (I am!)"

Over the years, the Navy Yard played a crucial role in the country’s military operations, especially during World War II when it employed over 70,000 workers and produced some of the most famous warships, including the USS Arizona and the USS Missouri.\nHowever, the Navy Yard’s role in the country’s defense dwindled, and it was eventually closed in 1966. Since then, the Brooklyn Navy Yard has undergone significant transformations, becoming an industrial park and center for innovation and technology. The site has been repurposed to offer a conducive environment for businesses to thrive, with over 400 businesses calling it home and employing over 11,000 people.\nToday, the Brooklyn Navy Yard is a hub of creativity, innovation, and technology. It is home to numerous companies in various sectors, such as biotech, green tech, and advanced manufacturing, among others. It is also a center for research and development, with a strong focus on sustainability and environmental protection. As such, the Brooklyn Navy Yard plays a critical role in shaping the future of innovation and technology, not just in New York City but also globally.\nOn his recent visit to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Mayor Adams was impressed by the cutting-edge research and development taking place at the new lab facility that focuses on sustainability-focused biotech. He pledged to support the facility’s growth by donating $20 million to help expand its operations. This donation is expected to foster the growth of the local biotech industry and make Brooklyn a hub for sustainable technology.\nDuring his visit, Mayor Adams also visited numerous companies in various sectors such as biotech, green tech, and advanced manufacturing, among others. His visit aimed to learn more about the businesses in the Brooklyn Navy Yard and their potential impact on the city’s economy.\nOne of the companies that Mayor Adams visited during his recent trip to the Brooklyn Navy Yard is Kintra Fibers. Kintra is a manufacturing company that produces high-performance fibers using sustainable materials. The company’s products are used in various applications, such as aerospace, defense, and industrial products.\nKintra’s mission is to create sustainable products that reduce the environmental impact of traditional manufacturing methods. The company achieves this by using eco-friendly materials and processes to produce its fibers. Kintra’s products are not only sustainable but also high-performing, making them attractive to various industries.\nIn conclusion, the Brooklyn Navy Yard is a vibrant hub of innovation and technology, with a rich history that dates back to the 19th century. Today, it is home to numerous companies in various sectors, such as biotech, green tech, and advanced manufacturing, among others. The site has been repurposed to offer a conducive environment for businesses to thrive, with a strong focus on sustainability and environmental protection.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 1896, the New York State Assembly and Brooklyn Common Council agreed to establish the Brooklyn Public Library. Prior to the library system’s creation, Brooklyn had a number of independently served libraries that were open to the public. Most, however, weren’t free, and required some kind of membership fee. The establishment of the Brooklyn Public Library system meant free widespread access for all. In 1897, the Bedford Library is the first location to open within the Brooklyn Public Library system. Throughout the 20th century, locations spanning all over Brooklyn would be built, including 21 locations that Andrew Carnegie donated $1.6 million for.\nThe Brooklyn Public Library is one of the largest public library systems in the nation, serving Brooklyn’s 2.7 million population across 61 different branches throughout the borough. Besides the branches themselves, there are also outreach sites in various locations such as schools and senior centers. The Brooklyn Public Library offers a multitude of services, from work development programs to cultural enrichment events to after-school educational programs. The Brooklyn Public Library system has been commended for its role in serving the Brooklyn population. The American Library Association’s 2014 Public Library Data Service Statistical Report ranked Brooklyn Public Library 3rd in the nation for its public programs and program attendance. Additionally, in 2016, the Brooklyn Public Library was rewarded an IMLS National Medal for Museum and Library Service due to the Outreach Service’s department’s efforts in aiding Brooklyn’s vulnerable populations.\nThe Brooklyn Public Library has also been at the forefront in fighting nationwide book banning efforts. In the past couple years, book banning efforts have surged throughout the United States. In 2021, the American Library Association (ALA) counted 729 challenges targeting 1,579 books. Between July 1, 2021, and June 30, 2022, bans occurred in 138 school districts over 32 states. Of these books, 41% explicitly address LGBTQ+ topics, and 40% contain protagonists or prominent secondary characters of color. School districts and libraries are banning books by the dozen, particularly due to pressure from conservative organizations and furious parents. They push against books regarding topics of race, sexuality, and gender. This has led to the harassment of librarians and adults showing up armed to library board meetings, as well as successful attempts in banning books all over the country.\n“Books Unbanned” is a Brooklyn Public Library program that allows teenagers in the US, regardless of state, to get a library card with the BPL system. With the digital library card, teenagers in states with book banning policies are able to maneuver around the restrictions and use the vast digital library that Brooklyn has to offer. Over 6,000 teenagers have created accounts since spring 2022, free to read without consequence. The Brooklyn Public Library also created the Intellectual Freedom Teen Council, where teens from all over the US can connect via a peer-support network, discussing topics such as censorship and intellectual freedom. With the tremendous efforts that the Brooklyn Public Library pours into supporting those that face banned books, it certainly lives up to its reputation of helping those who need it.\nFriedman, PhD, Jonathan, and Nadine Farid Johnson. “Banned in the USA: The Growing Movement to Censor Books in Schools.” PEN America 100, September 19, 2022. https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/.\nItalie, Hillel. “Book Ban Efforts Surging in 2022, Library Association Says.” AP News, September 16, 2022. https://apnews.com/article/libraries-american-library-association-book-banning-af7c9f312266b572c3dc189b1d109de4.\nSocial Networks and Archival Context. “Brooklyn Athenaeum,” n.d. https://snaccooperative.org/view/56500741.\nBarron, James. “Brooklyn Library’s ‘Books Unbanned’ Team Wins Accolade.” New York Times, January 4, 2023. https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/04/nyregion/brooklyn-public-library-books-unbanned.html.\n“Brooklyn Public Library,” n.d. https://www.bklynlibrary.org/about.\n“Why Book Burning Is Back.” YouTube, uploaded by Wisecrack, 24 October, 2022. https://youtu.be/MYnpMx12S6Q."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The East was a community center that played a significant role in the Black nationalist movement of the 1970s. It was established by a group of students from the African American Student Association (ASA) at 10 Claver Place in Brooklyn, New York, in 1968. The center was created as a response to the lack of resources and support available to Black communities at the time.\nThe East quickly became a hub of social and political activity, providing a range of programs and services for the community. One of its most notable initiatives was the Uhuru Sasa Shule, an independent school that offered a unique curriculum focused on African and African American history, culture, and empowerment. The school taught subjects such as agriculture, gardening, cooking, crafts, self-defense, dance, and Swahili alongside traditional academic subjects. The school also celebrated African and African American holidays, and its curriculum was designed to instill a sense of pride and identity in its students.\nIn addition to the school, The East offered a variety of programs and services, including a child development program called Imani, a jam session space, a publishing house, and adult education. The center also had several business enterprises, including the Mazavi Boutique and Kununuana, a food cooperative that offered fresh grains, herbal medicines, and other natural products.\nThe East was a vibrant and dynamic community center that played an essential role in promoting Black empowerment and community development. It’s reach went far beyond its own building; other centers related to it sprang up as well. These included The Far East in Queens, The Mid East in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and the Uhuru-East Bookstore and Cultural Center in Memphis, Tennessee. It was a place where people could come together to learn, grow, and support one another, and it left a lasting impact on the community even after it closed its doors in 1986. Its members continued the work that the center had started, establishing such organizations as the The Center for Law and Social Justice, Black Veterans for Social Justice, and Imani Day School Computer Campus. Today though, the msot lasting vestige of the East’s influence lies with the International African Arts Festival, which continues to celebrate and promote Black culture in Brooklyn and beyond.\nThe Arts festival actually began with the school when, in 1971, it held a street carnival celebrating the relevance of Africa to Black people worldwide. The festival continues takes place every year in the month of July, and it has been a significant cultural event in Brooklyn since its inception, and showcases a diverse range of African and African diaspora art.\n\n\n\nUntitled(1).png\n\n\nThe festival has become an important platform for artists from these cultures to showcase their talents and connect with audiences from all around the world. The festival features a wide range of programming, including performances by renowned musicians (among them Blue Magic, Steel Pulse, and Lauryn Hill), dance troupes, and theater groups, as well as exhibitions of contemporary and traditional African and African diaspora art. Visitors can also enjoy a variety of food vendors offering African and Caribbean cuisine, shop at the marketplace for handmade crafts, clothing, and jewelry, and participate in educational workshops and panel discussions. The International African Arts Festival is a testament to the legacy of The East and the importance of promoting and preserving African and African diaspora culture.\n\n\nReferences\n“About - International African Arts Festival.” International African Arts Festival -, June 22, 2019. https://iaafestival.org/about/.\nFondren, Precious. “The Center That Shaped Black Life in 1970s Brooklyn.” The New York Times, February 11, 2022, sec. New York. https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/11/nyregion/the-east-brooklyn-documentary.html.\nSurfaro, Monica. “The East, a Black Culture and Education Centers Brings Bit of Africa to Brooklyn.” The New York Times, August 17, 1975, sec. Archives. https://www.nytimes.com/1975/08/17/archives/the-east-a-black-culture-and-education-center-brings-bit-of-africa.html."

    "section": "",
    "text": "First constructed in 1916, the L train, officially known as the Canarsie line, has been a staple and vital transportation artery, connecting neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Since its inception in 1924, the L train has shaped the urban landscape and influencing the lives of countless residents and commuters. It was initially constructed to connect the neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Manhattan, specifically running from 14th Street and 6th Avenue in Manhattan to Canarsie in Brooklyn.\nCanarsie, a neighborhood in southeastern Brooklyn, experienced a transformation with the arrival of the L train. Historically a quiet, suburban area, Canarsie became more accessible to residents looking to commute to Manhattan for work or leisure. The L train provided a direct link, offering convenience and opportunities for economic growth within the neighborhood. As a result, Canarsie experienced a population boom, especially from those immigrating from the Caribbean islands, and witnessed the emergence of new businesses and residential developments.\nAs we move northwest to Bushwick and Williamsburg, the impact of the L train on these vibrant neighborhoods cannot be overstated, transforming it into a cultural and artistic hub that captivates both locals and visitors alike. With a rich history intertwined with the growth of the L train, Bushwick and Williamsburg has evolved from a working-class industrial area to a dynamic and sought-after destination. Once a thriving industrial neighborhood, in the 20th century, the decline of industry in the latter half of the century left the area in a state of neglect. The revitalization with the L train as its backbone, breathed a new life into the Bushwick Williamsburg areas. Connecting it to the heart of Manhattan and facilitating the influx of residents seeking more affordable housing options. Over time, the L train line facilitated the influx of artists, creatives, and young professionals who were drawn to the affordability and its burgeoning arts scene. The L train became a symbol of connectivity, fostering a sense of community and allowing the neighborhood’s cultural diversity to flourish.\nThe influence of the L train extends beyond the boroughs, reaching Manhattan and connecting it to the vibrant communities of Canarsie and Bushwick. Manhattan, with its bustling streets and towering skyscrapers, depends on the L train to transport commuters from the eastern parts of Brooklyn, enabling them to access the countless opportunities and rich experiences the city has to offer. The L train serves as a lifeline, not only for Manhattan’s residents but also for visitors who rely on its efficient and reliable services to explore the city’s iconic landmarks, cultural institutions, and vibrant neighborhoods.\nBut just like everything in life, there are always setbacks. During Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the Canarsie Tunnel suffered extensive flooding and subsequent infrastructure damage. This presented a major obstacle for the L train line and required extensive repairs to ensure the safety and reliability of the line. The “L Train Slowdown” was the proposed plan that was adopted. This approach aimed to minimize disruptions and reduce the impact on commuters and businesses. As well as, demonstrate the importance of considering community concerns and finding innovative solutions to minimize disruptions during the infrastructure improvements.\nSources\n\nhttps://gothamist.com/news/a-century-ago-nyc-didnt-even-have-an-l-train-to-complain-about\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/nyregion/l-train-repairs-shutdown.html\nhttps://www.curbed.com/article/williamsburg-brooklyn-new-bohemia-nyc.html\nhttps://www.departures.com/archive/art-culture/bushwick-brooklyn-art-scene\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/nyregion/l-train-subway-nyc.html#:~:text=every 100 seconds.-,In New York%2C only the L train and the No,90 percent on-time rate."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Green-Wood Cemetery was founded in 1838 helped start the trend for rural cemeteries when the dead that were usually buried in church yards or potter’s fields lacked burial space and a certain quiet aesthetic people started to crave in the early 19th century. It also set a trend for public parks because of its features that led families in the 1860s to frequent only second to the Niagara Falls the most popular tourist attraction in the nation at the time. However, people don’t only come to Green-Wood only for its 478 acres, seven thousand trees, 216 feet above elevation, or (quite frankly; no offense) 600,000 graves. In the 19th century, families went on outings at the cemetery for carriage rides and sculpture viewing— and it’s not much different today.\nThe sculptures in question refer to the opulent, historic architecture contained on its land. Those rich enough commissioned the architects (which were oft renown, such as the designer of Grand Central Terminal) of their own estates to build eclectic monuments rather than just gravestones to house and mark their eternal homes. Within the gothic reviving cemetery gates Greek temples, Renaissance palaces, Egyptian temples, Corinthian columns, obelisks, and any variety of Disneyland-like scaled mausoleums and vaults, sat inside. There used to be fifty graves made a day by a multitude of gravediggers, but despite its acreage, the cemetery almost named “Necropolis,” can now only make room for a handful of dead per day. With dwindling space— family members share plots and are laid to rest on top of each other— and the more economical cremation on the rise, there’s fewer new residents to the rural community. Still, its admittedly livelier, curious visitors haven’t been found themselves unwelcome yet.\nThanks to the nonprofit cemetery’s Historic Fund established in 1999, Green-Wood now homes a seven hundred-or-so-piece art collection of the many artists buried there (such as Jean-Michael Basquiat— though he’s not featured, as they must rely on more affordable and lesser known, but representative paintings) in its office and art installations. However, installations weren’t exclusive to the nonliving, but also to modern artists too, who wished to have their art in a catacomb, for example. Furthermore, posthumous notoriety wasn’t limited to artists, but a few Civil War soldiers and sailors and a couple hundred baseball pioneers as well. Though carriage rides are no longer readily available, the historic landmark’s fund continues to host tours and seasonal events open to the public to to this day.\nSources:\nhttps://www.green-wood.com/about-history/\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/nyregion/the-ones-who-prepare-the-ground-for-the-last-farewell.html\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/nyregion/07greenwood.html\nhttps://www.mcny.org/exhibition/beautiful-way-go\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1977/11/17/archives/design-notebook-pastoral-greenwood-cemetery-is-a-lesson-in.html\nfurther reading: https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/01/nyregion/ground-hallowed-cooperstown-green-wood-cemetery-home-200-baseball-pioneers.html"

    "title": "Friends of MTA: Brooklyn subway stations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Common complaints of subway stations in NYC include broken elevators, slippery stairs, and a lack of trash cans. These issues often go unnoticed by the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority). Recently, a new program in Brooklyn has surfaced, focusing on improving communication and accountability with regard to MTA train stations. Council Member Lincoln Restler announced this program in early March 2023. Under the name “Friends of MTA Station Initiative,” Restler is searching for commuters to volunteer to meet in groups with MTA officials. This is meant to encourage discussion between the MTA and riders.\nJon Orcutt, a transit advocate and transportation policy expert, believes this initiative will promote accountability. This initiative will start with five participating stations in northern Brooklyn: Jay Street, Nassau Avenue, Borough Hall, Bedford Avenue, and High Street. Friends of MTA is similar to “Friends of” groups for parks, as well as other public spaces and institutions. Prospect Park Alliance was founded in 1987 after years of deterioration in the park. A project they took on recently had to do with safety on Prospect Park Drive. Prospect Park Drive closed to outside vehicular traffic in 2018, and has never fully been redesigned since. Prospect Park Alliance released a study to provide information on the injuries and incidents that have occurred on Prospect Park Drive since its closure, in an attempt to call attention to the need of a redesign.\nFriends of MTA does not seek any donations, as it is mainly fueled by volunteers. Lincoln Restler aims at creating a ‘framework’ for accountability and station improvements that could make a “tangible difference” in the experiences of commuters. Newsbreak contributor Sara Irshad said that the initiative is “an excellent opportunity for New Yorkers to take an active role in improving the subway system.” The focus of Friends of MTA is on commuter involvement and communication with officials.\nMTA improvement advocacy existed long before the introduction of this initiative. Riders Alliance formed in 2012, and has become a prominent organization aiming at identifying issues in the wider MTA system, including busses. Riders Alliance is more of an advocating movement, while Friends of MTA is directly involved with officials. Another key difference is that Friends of MTA is focused on five subway stations instead of the entire system. A press release states, “Groups will meet with MTA and other agency officials to discuss station conditions, conduct walkthroughs, and learn more about what is currently done under MTA’s operating and capital budgets. The purpose of this engagement model is to provide the community with a better understanding of their stations and have a consistent line of communication with the MTA.” Communication is key in the functionality of this initiative. Although there hasn’t been word on it yet, the Friends of MTA program may extend to more stations in the future, or inspire similar programs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Brooklyn Museum is the second largest museum in New York City. It is home to many different unique art pieces and performances. The museum was built in 1897 and it was one of the very first museums to display African art and culture. The genre ranges from European to Greek across the entire institution. Feel free to stop by as there are constant events, art shows, and displays always there at your disposal.\nThe ticket prices for the Brooklyn Museum range from $10- $40 depending on what you want to explore. As always, tickets are discounted for all students to attend the museum. You can even choose to go on guided tours of the museum, attend shows, and more. However despite these nagging prices for tickets, you can possibly attend the museum for free if you join on what is known as the first Saturday.\nThe first Saturday is a monthly event that the Brooklyn Museum has every Saturday that comes first in each month. During this event, the general admission to the museum is completely free for every one who wants to join. It is best to hurry in purchasing the tickets for First Saturday a couple weeks in advance because registration for the events fills up very fast. If by any means registration fills up and you still want to attend, if you purchased a membership at the museum, it is still possible to attend for free admission.\nThe Brooklyn Museum has many different pieces of works and art. One area that is particularly lively with colors and creative/graphic is the American exhibition. The exhibition is very diverse ranging from people and objects of all different colors, shapes, sizes, and etc. Touring the American exhibition is such a unique experience because through simple pictures or objects can spread such a powerful message about American society and its evolution.\nMany art pieces depict figures of many important time periods. The early 1900s during the Harlem Renaissance, the Women’s movement (late 1900s), and etc. The Harlem Renaissance was a lively time period for African American culture and art representation. It was a time for African American society to build its community and identity in order to rise up beyond a time where they were severely dehumanized. The above photo depicts a woman who is a working African American during the early 1900s in the time of the Harlem Renaissance a s described by the artist. The symbolic photo shows how African American women persevered and broke through stereotypical barriers that made it very difficult to integrate into American society after slavery.\nThe Women’s movement was a growing cultural turning point in American society in the late 1900s. This was an era where women were trying to defeat the patriarchal society that America was based off on. The ultimate goal was of course an equal society between men and women or more of an established matriarchy. The vase shown above displays a famous woman figure known as Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She was a woman born in 1933 and one of the first women who attended Harvard Law School and became a lawyer, known in that time as a man’s profession. She also worked her way up and ended up becoming one of the first women to be on the Supreme Court. Ginsburg was a powerful catalyst in the women’s movement and constantly proved that women are capable of achieving any goals and dreams that a man can.\nThe art pieces in Brooklyn Museum or of vastly different genres and time periods in history. It is interesting to see many of these different pieces collectively together in one room. There are many other genres that the museum displays beside the American exhibition such as Greece, Ancient times, African fashion, and etc. For a more in-depth analysis on the world’s history you can take a tour across all the exhibitions the museum has to offer."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Untitled\n\n\nThe Canarsee Indians lived generally undisturbed until nearly 150 years after European settlers arrived in adjacent Gravesend in 1643. In the 18th century, the Wyckoff and Lott families built homesteads and farms. Built in 1766, the Henry and Abraham Wyckoff House still stands today on the corner of Kings Highway and East 22nd Street. One Wyckoff family home was built in 1652. It is the Pieter Claesen House in today’s Flatlands, Brooklyn, and it is believed to be the city’s oldest surviving home. Restored in 1982, the Pieter Claesen House is now a public museum. The Hendrick I. Lott House, built in 1720 and enlarged in 1800, is also a landmark home in Flatlands, located on East 36th Street.\nFishing in the bay became popular in the early 19th century, and little cottages were built along the rim. Sheepshead Bay was named after the Sheepshead fish, and since pre-colonial times, it has been a place for fishing, sailing, and other maritime activities. The bay was originally part of the Coney Island Creek. In the 1840s and before, the area was a secluded community of farming and fishing. It became a vacation destination beginning in the summer of 1840. Benjamin Freeman owned much of the land around the bay, and in 1844, opened one of the first hotels here. He called it The Sheepshead, named after the common marine fish. This would give the area its name. Tourists came in the mid-19th century, when more hotels were built, like Sam Leonard’s Hotel and Tappen’s Hotel. When Ocean Avenue was opened, it became the first direct route to the area.\nDuring the 19th century, the bay area did not have a reputation as luxurious as Manhattan Beach and Brighton Beach. In the 1870s, a large farm was subdivided for development. This led to more development, including 400 houses being built by the end of the century, as well as shops, churches, and a post office. Businesses such as seafood restaurants started to be built on Emmons Avenue. The Ocean Avenue Footbridge was built by Austin Corbin in 1880. It allows people to cross the bay, connecting Emmons Avenue and East 19th street to Manhattan Beach.\nAs a recreational spot, sports were popular in Sheepshead Bay. Besides fishing and boating, there was horse racing. In 1880, the Coney Island Jockey Club founded a racetrack, which sparked population growth in nearby areas. Gilded Age moguls funded the sport. Among these was August Belmont Jr., who was known as the godfather of horse racing.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe Sheepshead Bay racetrack, taken by George Bradford Brainard, courtesythe Brooklyn Museum\nIn 1911, the Vin Fiz, piloted by Calbraith P. Rodgers, used the Sheepshead Bay Race Track as its runway when it made the world’s first transcontinental flight. Racetrack betting would become illegal in the 1910s, making the track repurposed for auto racing. In 1915, the Sheepshead Speedway replaced the track when the Coney Island Jockey Club disbanded. Italian racing legend Dario Resta drove an automobile here when he raced an airplane steered by pioneering pilot Katherine Stinson.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFromthe Library of Congress\nAuto racing lasted from 1915-1919, but this too fell out of popular tourism attractions. Not far away, Coney Island opened and had a subway connection. This also decreased tourism to Sheepshead Bay. The race track was subdivided for housing and bungalows were set up along Millionaire’s Row. This increased the amount of permanent residents. The automobile track was completely demolished in 1919, replaced with housing.\nThe channel of the Sheepshead Bay waterway was dredged by 1916 and dredged further in 1922, by the New York City Dock Commission. The City improved the neighborhood in the 1930s, widening Emmons Avenue and modernizing buildings. Sheepshead Bay residents wanted a place to store their boats and socialize with locals, leading to the formation of yacht clubs. Among these was the Miramar Boat and Canoe Club, founded in 1938. During the Second World War, Sheepshead Bay had a maritime training station that opened on September 1, 1942 and took up 76 acres across the Bay. Around 115,000 servicemen were trained there. Kingsborough Community College now sits at this site. In the 1950s, brick apartment buildings replaced wooden houses. By 1960, Sheepshead Bay was the fastest growing Brooklyn community.\nSheepshead bay was once predominantly Irish and Italian, but became a more diverse neighborhood over the years. The population increased during the 20th century. Jewish and Soviet immigrants arrived in the mid-late 20th century. Avenue U Chinatown is partially in Sheepshead Bay. Albanians, Turks and Hispanics also live in the neighborhood. Today, Sheepshead Bay is mostly residential. Condos are more common near Ocean Avenue, the center of the neighborhood. The northern shoreline along the bay has piers and tour boats, and many restaurants can be found in the area. Four branches of the Brooklyn Public Library are in the neighborhood.\nZohra Saedis a poet from Jalalabad, Afghanistan, who came to Brooklyn with her family in the 1980s. It was comfortable to settle in Sheepshead Bay due to there being many other Turkic people there. She lived on Ocean Avenue in Sheepshead Bay, where there was an Uzbek-Turkestani community. In an interview for the Coney Island History Project, Zohrareads “Brooklyn” and “Neptune Avenue,” poems that connect to her childhood. She writes about the place she and her friends used to play between Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay, and her times at the boardwalk along Coney Island. Zohra remembers playing in between the Brighton Beach bungalows, where some of her friends lived. She tells of ghost stories from Lundy’s and how she would dream of horses when she lived in a building where there were once horse races nearby. Sheepshead Bay had many diverse and multicultural spaces such as Russian, Turkish, and later Chinese American. Access to Southern Brooklyn involved access to beaches and getting invited over to other families’ homes. Zohra spoke Farsi, Uzbek, and Arabic before learning English at PS 254, a diverse school where she bonded with teachers and students. She went to Cunningham in Homecrest for junior high school, Sheepshead Bay High School, and Brooklyn College. She has an MFA in poetry from Brooklyn College and a PhD in Literature from the CUNY Grad Center. She also translates poetry from Turkestani and is a Distinguished Lecturer at Macaulay Honors College.\nLearn More\nBowery Boys. “No Sheep in Sheepshead Bay, but Lots of Fish with Human Teeth.” The Bowery Boys: New York City History, 20 Feb. 2014, https://www.boweryboyshistory.com/2014/02/no-sheep-in-sheepshead-bay-but-lots-of.html.\nNYC Parks.

    "section": "",
    "text": "As early as 1800, plans were conceptualized for a bridge connecting Brooklyn and Manhattan, which were separate cities at the time. Before this time, the cities’ only connection was by ferry. Ultimately, the design that turned into the Brooklyn Bridge was made by John Augustus Roebling in 1852. According to the plan, this would become the tallest suspension bridge in the world. John A. Roebling passed away after a tetanus infection in 1869, which left his son Washington Roebling to replace him as chief engineer. The leader of Tammany Hall, a powerful political organization in New York, William Tweed became involved with the construction of the bridge at this time. The New York Bridge Company, incorporated in 1867, was overseen by Tammany Hall. Washington Roebling’s wife, Emily Warren Roebling, also played a major role in the construction of the bridge. She understood advanced mathematics, and taught herself the technical issues so that she could assist with the Brooklyn Bridge’s construction.\nThe project didn’t go without criticism. Some people thought the bridge would be too expensive to build or even too difficult. To calm these fears, John Roebling held a “bridge party” in 1869, gathering engineers and congress members to discuss the project. He showed his record of other successful suspension bridges at this meeting. After John Roebling’s death, the project was beginning to be thought of as “cursed.” Tammany Hall controlling the bridge company may have also caused worry, as the organization was known for political corruption.\nThe construction work involved was very dangerous. It required digging sediment into an air-pressurized caisson. They needed to work in the water of the East River. The temperatures would rise to 80 degrees in the summer while the water was ice cold. This would mean that workers were often shirtless in the cold water because the temperatures were too high. Several fires broke out during the work on the caisson on the Manhattan side. One of those fires was named “The Great Blowout,” which caused significant damage caisson. “Caisson Disease,” also known as “the bends,” was developed by workers who entered the pressurized air and exited too fast. Washington Roebling, who worked in the caisson himself, developed this “disease” which was later found to be decompression sickness. Since this paralyzed him, his wife Emily helped him finish the project. She was crucial in this stage of construction, and was able to assume the duties of chief engineer when Washington couldn’t. Her contribution came at a time where higher education was not as accessible for women, so her brilliance and knowledge of math and engineering was a triumph.\nThe construction of the bridge took 14 years and cost 15 million dollars, which is $130 million today. On May 24 1883, the grand opening of what was called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge commenced. Thousands of people were present for the momentous event. In attendance was President Chester A. Arthur, New York Governor Grover Cleveland, and of course New York City’s Mayor Franklin Edison. More than 150,000 people walked across the bridge within the first 24 hours. This was made possible by a promenade above the roadway designed by John Augustus Roebling specifically for pedestrians.\nThe legacy of the Brooklyn Bridge can be characterized in multiple ways. Unfortunately, at least 27 people died during construction with tragedy continuing beyond the opening. Accidents, homicides, and suicides have taken place, giving the bridge it’s “cursed” reputation. Another way to characterize it is by its record-breaking achievement of connecting two important places. It directly led to the consolidation of New York City in 1898, which conjoined Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as the other boroughs known today. Another often overlooked aspect of the Brooklyn Bridge’s legacy is Emily Warren Roebling role, which may have inspired and paved the way for future female engineers.\nSources:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn_Bridge\nhttps://www.citysignal.com/the-history-of-the-brooklyn-bridge-and-its-dark-legacy/\nhttps://www.history.com/topics/landmarks/brooklyn-bridge"

Towards the end of the 17th century, the Dutch would come and colonize the location, with Wolfert Gerritsen building his fieldhouse there, giving the creek his namesake. Later on in the 1900s Jamaica Bay was planned to become a port, which would greatly affect the creek, and so 150 acres of land was donated to the area so that it could become a park.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Brooklyn Heights Promenade, measures roughly 1800 feet and, is a free public space that offers an incredible view of Downtown Manhattan, the East River and Brooklyn Bridge. Tourists are attracted to this area because of these views as well as the surrounding neighborhood, which accompanies beautiful brownstone houses and healthy trees. The promenade mostly attracts joggers and families. Besides being famous for its view it is also famous for three monuments. Its most famous is the flagpole at the bottom of Montague Street in tribute to Genevieve Beavers Earle (1885-1956), a Brooklyn Heights resident and civic leader. Earle was the first woman to serve in the New York City Council and was an independent republican who fought for the creation of playgrounds and recreational centers. The Promenade opened to the public in 1827 and later in 1952, became popular as a gay dating site, which was not immediately accepted by local residents. Due to this, the Promenade is also recognized as a LGBT historic landmark.\nRobert Moses was head of construction for New York City’s housing authority and wanted to build a multilane of highways to connect the five buroughs. However, after there was a great amount of public opposition, the location of the multi-lane highways that began construction in 1939, was moved to the western end of the neighborhood. Later in 1946, Gilmore Clarke and Michael Rapuano, two landscape architects, constructed the 11.7 mile expressway and 1,826 foot long Promenade we know today. The walkable public parkway was constructed along the East River escarpment, saving space and minimizing intrudement into the surrounding Brooklyn Heights neighborhood. The Promenade opened in 1950 and is edged with fencing and currently has benches where visitors can sit along the walkway. By 1952, The promenade had become a site for gay male cruising. In the early 1960’s, it attracted gay men from all over the city. Armand Whitehead, a man who moved to Brooklyn Heights in 1963, said “It was absolutely wild. People did everything there.”\nCurrently, the promenade is no longer a site where gay men prefer to cruise the same way they did in the 1950’s and 60’s. However, it is still loved by many residents in the community. The Promenade overlooks the basketball courts at Brooklyn Bridge Park and is a perfect place to go when weather is nice, especially if you are hoping for a spectacular view. It’s featured in many guidebooks, like Trip Advisor, Trip Savvy and NYCgo.com. The Brooklyn Heights Promenade is a location that remains loved by its residents and tourists from all over the world.\nAdams, Rose. “How Brooklyn Women Paved the Way for Women in Politics.” Brooklyn Paper, March 29, 2021. https://www.brooklynpaper.com/brooklyn-paved-the-way-women-in-politics/.\n“Brooklyn Heights Promenade: Attractions in Brooklyn, NY.” NYCgo.com.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Wisconsin Iceberg shaped Long Island, Manhattan, and the Bronx millions of years ago, carving depressions in the soil. This gave the land a terrain of hills and small ponds. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden was founded on land that was once a marshy wasteland, but it has been transformed into one of New York City’s most beautiful parks.\nIn 1825, Andre Parmentier established a garden in today’s Prospect Heights. This was the first instance of a botanic garden being created in Brooklyn. Over time, Brooklyn would expand, and urban development would replace farmland. Commercial nurseries and greenhouses were mostly established in neighborhoods with little development but lots of open land. They had a significant demand for flowers and unique plants. Beginning in 1859, plans were made to construct Prospect Park, which now contains the Botanic Garden, the Museum, and other attractions. A 12-man group set out to start this task, but it was put on hold for several years due to the American Civil War. The City of Brooklyn acquired the site for the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, bounded by Eastern Parkway, Empire Boulevard, Flatbush Avenue and Washington Avenue, as part of the June 15, 1864 purchase of Prospect Park. Brooklyn businessman and philanthropist Alfred Tredway White formed a committee to advocate for a botanic garden near the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Science. The eastside land of the purchase remained unused for several years until the New York State Legislature created the Botanic Garden in 1897. 39 acres were reserved for “a botanic garden and arboretum for the collection and propagation of plants, flowers, shrubs and trees and also for the advancement of knowledge and research pertaining to botanical science, the exhibition of ornamental and decorative horticulture, and for entertainment, recreation and education of the general public,” as the Brooklyn Eagle reported at the time.\nArchitect William Kendall of the architectural firm McKim, Mead, & White is credited for his design of the garden’s Laboratory Administration Building. Director Gager sent out letters to colleagues asking them for the names of the most important botanists in history. Kendall’s building was modeled after the vernacular churches of Lombardy in Italy. A decorative frieze under the eaves is inscribed with 68 names, two of which are Darwin and Linnaeus. The architectural firm also designed the nearby Brooklyn Museum of Art. When the museum opened in 1902, the site was known as Institute Park. In 1910, the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences was assigned with management of the garden. At that point in their history, the Institute directed the Brooklyn Museum, the Botanic Garden, the Brooklyn Children’s Museum, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music. In 1910, the garden was founded, and botanist Charles Stuart Gager was the director. The Olmsted Brothers firm laid out the original plan for the site. The Brooklyn Botanic Garden officially opened on May 13, 1911.\nWhen Brooklyn Botanic Garden was established, New York City was quickly being developed into a city of buildings and paved roads. Creating a public garden was one way to ensure that some green space remained. Today, the Garden represents the very best in urban gardening and horticultural display. BBG’s first garden was designed to display and conserve native plants. The original form was designed by research taxonomist Norman Taylor, BBG’s first director. The Native Flora Garden, founded in 1911, is one of the Brooklyn Botanic’s oldest gardens. In 1912, Harold Caparn was appointed as the Garden’s landscape architect. Caparn would design much of the site over the next three decades. The Children’s Garden, an educational center designed to teach children about plant life, opened in 1914. One of the first programs of its kind, this one-acre vegetable garden gives city children a place to grow their own food plants. Children’s gardens would continue to be created across the country.\n\n\n\nChildren’s Garden, 1915. Photo by Louis Buhle.\n\n\nChildren’s Garden, 1915.

White, one of the garden’s benefactors who contributed $25,000 towards the development of the Brooklyn Botanic in 1909. The Japanese Garden’s pond is in one of the pools that the Wisconsin Iceberg had formed. It was the first public Japanese garden in the United States.\n\n\n\nJapanese Hill-and-Pond Garden, 1916.

Photo by Susan De Vries\nIn 1925, the Bonsai Collection formed after a gift of 32 bonsai from local plantsman Ernest F. Coe. In 1928, the Cranford Rose Garden was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. Walter V. Cranford. The garden has been renovated several times since then, but several of the original plants remain today. The Cranford Rose Garden features more than 1,000 types of roses, and Magnolia Plaza, established in 1932, has 17 types of magnolias.\n\n\n\nMagnolias in bloom in early spring, 2019. Photo by Susan De Vries\n\n\nMagnolias in bloom in early spring, 2019. Photo by Susan De Vries\nIn 1938, the Original Herb Garden, a gift of the Auxiliary, was established near the Washington Avenue entrance. It was a Caparn design taken from a 1577 Elizabethan knot garden. Works Progress Administration (WPA) workers did some of the labor. The 1939 Italian-style Osborne Garden was also built with labor from the Civil Works Administration and the WPA. Along the Cherry Esplanad, Kwanzan cherry trees (Prunus serrulata) can be found. These were planted in 1941. Alice Recknagel Ireys designed the Fragrance Garden in 1955, and this was the first public garden made for the visually impaired.\nThe Brooklyn Botanic Garden separated from the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences in the 1970s. An independent administration now maintains the botanic garden. In 1988, the Steinhardt Conservatory was completed. The Steinhardt Conservatory houses the Bonsai Museum, the Warm Temperate Pavilion, the Tropical Pavilion, the Trail of Evolution, the Aquatic House, the Desert Pavilion and the Palm House.\n\n\n\nThe C.V.

In 2015, the New Discovery Garden opened. Designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, this one-acre children’s garden features interactive exhibits set in a variety of habitats, including meadows, woodlands, and marshes. In 2016, the Shelby White and Leon Levy Water Garden opened. Designed by Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, this 1.5 garden features wetland plants and provides a basis for the Garden-wide Water Conservation Project. Its pond and brook help the Garden to store excess rainwater, which assists in preventing the city’s storm drains from flooding.\nThe Brooklyn Botanic Garden houses many gardens including the Cherry Esplanade, Discovery Garden, Fragrance Garden, Herb Garden, Japanese Hill-and-Pond garden, Lily Pool Terrace and Borders, Native Flora Garden, Osborne Garden, Overlook, Plant Family Collection, Rock Garden, Rose Garden, Shakespeare Garden, Water Garden, and Woodland Garden. Some of its popular collections include conifers, flowering cherries, lilacs, a maple grove, orchids, roses, and tree peonies. It also features Bluebell Wood, Celebrity Path, the Composting Exhibit, Daffodil Hill, Ginkgo Allee, Magnolia Plaza, and the Visitor Center.\nToday covering 52 acres of land, the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is one of the most extensive botanical gardens in the world. The park is located in the center of Brooklyn. There are over 12,000 plant species from other parts of the world, with some dating back as far as three centuries. The park is home to over 200 cherry trees. Today, about a million people visit each year to observe the diverse plants and flowers. Until 1996, entrance to the Botanic Garden was free. However, the garden began charging admission as a result of a lack of funding from the city, state, and other sources. Today, the garden also gets support from membership and fundraising events as well as public and private funding. Plant swaps and sales, and a variety of events, including the annual Hanami Cherry Festival, make the garden one of the busiest public venues in Brooklyn. Non-members have to pay a fee to access the garden on most days, but entrance is free every Friday morning until noon from March to November. From December to February, the garden is free on weekdays, except for Monday. To experience all of the different gardens, spend about 2 to 3 hours at the garden. Other nearby attractions include the Prospect Park Zoo and the Brooklyn Museum.\n********************Learn More********************\n“A Brief History of BBG.” Brooklyn Botanic Garden, https://www.bbg.org/about/history.

    "section": "",
    "text": "December 1 2022 the MTA announced that they would be creating major updates to many routes along the bus network in Brooklyn. This includes cutting stops, removing lines, etc. All in the name of faster travel time for bus rides.\nPublic events started early in 2023 in order to connect more with the people and inform them of details of the plan. This also includes workshops to gather input on these proposed ideas. With dates ranging from mid April to early May, there is plenty of opportunity to go to one of these events and put in the much needed feedback. They take place at various subway stations around New York City, and are held from 3-7 pm.\n\n\n\nimage credit:https://new.mta.info/project/brooklyn-bus-network-redesign\n\n\nAbove is the proposed redesign for the bus network.\nThe proposed plan has faced a lot of backlash from the community of Brooklynites. While the plan claims to speed up the flow of buses and create a shorter travel time, it ultimately undermines its entire purpose. The current travel time already isn’t completely awful like the plan makes it out to be. “Contrary to MTA’s claims that Brooklyn’s local buses travel at an unacceptable average speed of 7 mph, such speed is reasonable, not slow, when considering that in Brooklyn on local streets, the average automobile speed is only about 10 mph. Buses travel slightly slower than cars because they necessarily must make more stops.” (Bklyner) There are certainly problems with bus congestion or general traffic in the streets, but that is not addressed in the plan. A plan that would also make what it plans to fix worse. “Eliminating heavily utilized stops increases dwell time at adjacent stops. Bus stop removal saves only a fraction of the claimed average of 20 seconds per bus stop removed. The likelihood of missing the bus also increases, having it pass by while walking the further distance to the nearest stop. That also increases overall travel time.” More people are inconvenienced by the removing of stops, as people who lived by those stops now have to travel more to stops that are generally farther away. The plan is not shortening the travel time, it just restructures your schedule so you spend less time actually riding the bus and more time walking to and from bus stations, which is probably the worst part of traveling somewhere via public transportation.\nSources:\nAre You Listening, MTA?

    "text": "In 1999, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani planned to auction off 112 community gardens, to which community gardeners of the city fought to save their gardens from Giuliani’s actions. When a lawsuit was filed, it was able to stop the auction, and the gardens were not only saved but improved and economically supported by restoration projects and initiatives. In 2004, the Brooklyn Queens Land Trust (BQLT) began to manage community gardens in Brooklyn and Queens, now a nonprofit organization with hundreds of volunteers. The gardens owned by BQLT are permanently open spaces, and they cannot be bought, developed, or sold. The People’s Garden in Bushwick, Brooklyn, is one of the 35 community gardens owned by the BQLT.\nKnown for its dance floor and performance deck that regularly holds salsa parties and other community events, The People’s Garden encourages community bonding and transforms the agency and relationship between and amongst the Bushwick community. It was established by Hernan Pagan, lovingly nicknamed the “heart” of the garden, who actively rebukes the gentrification of Bushwick and the misogyny and homophobia that exists within communities of New York City. When faced with those who disapprove of Pagan’s openness regarding his garden, such as queer members of the community or women from shelters, he simply says, “Then don’t come!” The People’s Garden was created by the people of Bushwick, as expansive as can be, for the people of Bushwick (which Pagan repeatedly emphasizes).\nGazebos, chicken coops, and salsa parties belong to the community garden that is The People’s Garden, which is fueled by the people and works to create harmony between Bushwick locals. In recent efforts to combat gentrification and discrimination, The People’s Garden is one example of many of how local New Yorkers can strive to create spaces built for and by themselves.\n\n\n\nbqlt.jpeg\n\n\nSources\nFellman, Samantha. “Oral History Interview Conducted with Hernan Pagan on 2016 August 01.” Brooklyn Public Library, 2016, www.bklynlibrary.org/digitalcollections/item/59b38f28-4c3c-4ae0-b07a-e12f6991ead3.\nhttps://bqlt.org/"

Founded in 2010, CYMP, is determined to “promote social inclusion in New York City by empowering youth and children in Corona, Queens to excel through their participation in musical ensembles” (nucleocorona.org About tab).\nCorona, Queens is a multicultural neighborhood. The area is home to many members of the Latin American community. Corona’s diversity is shown through the different foods, language, accents, clothing, practices, and customs that are publicly expressed. Although the area may not be the most pleasant to walk through, Corona’s vibrancy is maintained through its multicultural backgrounds and icons. Such icons include Citi Field, flushing meadows park, and home of a very influential jazz legend, Louis Armstrong.\nThe Corona Youth Music project is the first in Queens inspired by “El Sistema”, “a global movement of social action through music” (nucleocorona.org El Sistema tab). El Sistema began in Venezuela in 1975 by José Maestro Abreu. He was determined to give the children of underserved communities the education to participate in orchestras and choirs; and believed that with their instruments his students will change the world (nucleocorona.org El Sistema tab). His influence spread around Venezuela, followed by the rest of Latin America, and later the whole world.\nThe Corona Youth Music project is a free music education program as well as a safe and fun place for the community. CYMP has three orchestras; No Frontiers, a beginning level ensemble, Corona Children’s Orchestra, and Corona Youth Orchestra. Within the program, students build a strong community bond. Students practice teamwork, inspire each other, and mentor the young participants of the community as well as each other.\nThe program showcases the students growth and accomplishments through joyful and energetic performances that are open to the local community and the rest of NYC for free! For example, each year during the holiday season CYMP holds a showcase where students perform music that spells out the holiday spirt. Such classical pieces include, A Christmas festival, Rudolf the Red Nose Reindeer, Sleigh Ride, Christmas in the kitchen, and much more. Students also perform famous pieces such as those of Beethoven, Georges Bizet, Franz Schubert, Leroy Anderson, and many more.\nToday the Corona Youth Music Project holds its ensembles in P.S 19 Q, one of the largest and oldest public school in the city, and welcomes in new members each year.\nSUB TOPIC\nUPBeat NYC is another program inspired by “El Sistema” in the Bronx. There are many instance where UPBeat NYC collaborates with the Corona Youth Music project, and the result is a spectacular! breathtaking! performance by both programs.\nP.S 19 Q is a public elementary school in Corona, Queens. Being a school since 1923, the school continues to expand and maintain its doors open to all incoming students.\nANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY\nNúñez, Álvaro F.

    "title": "Homelessness in NYC",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Homelessness in New York City is a crisis. We are facing an unprecedented homeless population that beats the rate from the Great Depression. Tens of thousands of adults and children sleep in the city’s shelters every night, and this rate is significantly higher than it was ten years ago. Not much is being done by the city government to combat this, and what is being done is insufficient or not solving the problem. The lack of affordable housing drives homelessness, followed by eviction, overcrowded housing, domestic violence, job loss, and hazardous housing conditions. Homeless people come from every community district in New York City, proving that this is a widespread problem, and suffer from higher rates of mental illness and addiction disorders. All of this is true, but city surveys significantly under-represent homeless statistics.\nThe current mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, has implemented a new policy in his first years as mayor to combat homelessness. He has been conducting sweeps on city streets and subway stations and cars, taking the homeless people there to shelters. Despite his best efforts, only thirty percent of homeless people being swept are still in those shelters after a week, and the rest are released. That remaining seventy percent return to the streets, undoing any progress Mayor Adams has caused. Homeless advocates, mental health advocates, and police officers all disagree with his policy. Homeless advocates say that the policing and forced removal is not the correct approach, and, instead, there needs to be a health and housing lens when looking at the problem. Mental health advocates say that Mayor Adams’ policy is a human rights violation, and the city has the power to provide onsite mental health treatment in shelters and supported housing. Police officers say that the sweeping and extra policing of homeless people places liability on them in dangerous situations, and could be fuel for escalation.\nProviding accessible and supportive housing is the best way to prevent and solve homelessness. In every trial, it has reduced the need for the solutions Mayor Adams is proposing: shelters, hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and incarceration. It raises stability for tenants and reduces chronic homelessness for single adults. Economically, it has also been a boost. Real estate values rise in areas closest to supportive housing. Outside of statistics, supportive housing is just humane. Mayor Adams’ solution of sweeping homeless people into shelters (which are dangerous and uncomfortable for anyone) ignores their basic human autonomy.\nTo end homelessness, there needs to be a streamlined connection between the city and state governments. Oftentimes, they are at odds with each other, which only furthers the homelessness crisis and the mistreatment of homeless people. With a united approach on homelessness, featuring supportive housing and treatment, then the New York City homelessness rate could finally lower."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2019, Govenor Andrew Cuomo began to crack down on New York City subway crime. In an effort to improve quality of life, he focused the New York Police Department on fare evasion and subway vendors. Since then, New York City subways have become flooded with NYPD. Despite this, the organization is in debt, and politicians have been looking for ways to earn more money. Cracking down on subway vendors looked like the answer. Mayor Eric Adams continued the initiative when he was inaugerated on January 1st, 2022.\nIn May 2022, a video of a subway vendor, María Falcon, getting handcuffed and arrested next to her cart of mangos went viral on Twitter. Outrage sparked from New Yorkers and non-New Yorkers alike. Falcon was an immigrant woman from Ecuador trying to make a living. Mayor Adams confronted this outrage by saying that, if subway vendors were allowed to continue, then greater risks will follow, such as propane tanks and barbeques in subway stations. This is rooted in the broken windows theory, which promotes cracking down on small crimes to prevent larger crimes. The broken windows theory is notorious for being ineffective, yet many police departments, including the NYPD, follow it.\nThe villification of subway vendors does nothing to stop crime. Falcon was arrested at Broadway Junction, a station in Brooklyn with five trains. It was notoriously dangerous, with violence and drugs being the norm. The NYPD rarely stops these crimes, but that did not stop them from arresting Falcon. If Mayor Adams really cared about subway crime, then why are people afraid of knives and subway pushers at Broadway Junction?\nFood vendors like Falcon are not the only victims of this treatment. John Ajilo was a saxophonist at Herald Square station in Manhattan known for the tiny robot kittens he performs with. He is a beloved character that has been at Herald Square for decades. In June 2022, he was arrested and detained for hours overnight. Just like with Falcon, outraged sparked. A GoFundMe was launched and raised over $110,000 for Ajilo’s legal fees.\nMayor Adams defends this policing by saying that subway vendors and performers obstruct traffic flow. Specifically about vendors, he says that they need a liscense of sell food. However, it is immensely difficult to obtain a vending license because it is capped at 5,000 in New York City and there are 2,500 people on the waitlist.\nThe Street Vendor Project is a nonprofit that defends street vendors like the ones being harrassed in New York City subway stations. They say that subway vendors are part of New York City culture. Also, they say that subway vendors support the economy by responding to consumer demand. The Street Vendor Project’s work includes helping subway vendors get liscenses so they do not have to fear the NYPD as much.\nArresting subway vendors and street performers is not the answer to subway crime. The NYPD is already overpowered, and this initiative will only harm more immigrant communities and communities of color."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The persistent presence of rats in the city streets and alleys has long been a defining characteristic of New York City, with its impact felt by residents, businesses, and visitors alike. With a complex and intertwined history, the rat problem has become a symbol of urban challenges and the relentless battle for control.\nThe history of the rat problem can be traced back to the early days of urbanization and industrialization during the 18th century. As the city grew rapidly in the 19th century, the proliferation of tenement housing, overcrowded neighborhoods, and inadequate waste management created the ideal breeding ground for rats. These resilient rodents thrived on the abundant food sources and hidden shelter opportunities offered by the city’s densely populated areas.\nOne significant turning point in the battle against rats came in the mid-20th century with the introduction of modern sanitation practices. The New York City Department of Health (NYCDOH) implemented more stringent regulations regarding garbage collection, storage, and disposal, aiming to curb the rat population. These efforts, coupled with improved building maintenance and public health initiatives, showed some success in reducing the rat infestation levels.\nHowever, despite these early victories, the rat problem remains a significant issue in NYC. The resilience and adaptability of rats, combined with the constant influx of waste and human activity, have posed ongoing challenges in eradicating their presence. Rats continue to exploit the city’s infrastructure, utilizing subway tunnels, sewer systems, and hidden crevices as pathways for movement and nesting.\nThe impact of the rat problem extends beyond mere nuisance. Rats can carry and spread diseases, posing risks to public health. They can also cause damage to infrastructure, electrical wiring, and property, leading to significant financial burdens for individuals and businesses. Additionally, the perception of rats in the city can have a negative impact on tourism and public perception of cleanliness and livability.\nEfforts to address the rat problem in NYC have persisted throughout the years. The city has implemented various initiatives, including increased rodent inspections, targeted baiting programs, public education campaigns, and community involvement. Local communities and organizations have also taken proactive measures, like improving waste management practices and advocating for better infrastructure design to minimize rat habitats.\nDespite these ongoing efforts, the rat problem in NYC remains a complex issue that requires multifaceted solutions. It necessitates a collaborative approach involving government agencies, community organizations, businesses, and residents working together to address sanitation practices, improve infrastructure, and raise awareness about the importance of rat control. And with the appointment of a new “Rat Czar” we can be looking forward to the potential change about to come.\nThe rat problem in NYC has a deep-rooted history and continues to pose challenges for the city. It affects public health, infrastructure, and the overall perception of the city. By implementing comprehensive strategies and promoting a shared responsibility, the aim can be reached to diminish the impact of the rat problem. Ensuring a cleaner and safer environment for its residents and visitors.\nSources\n\nhttps://www.insider.com/new-york-city-explosive-increase-rats-over-last-65-years-2023-3#:~:text=They’ve been in New,city%2C according to The Atlantic.\nhttps://www.popsci.com/new-york-city-rats/\nhttps://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/249-23/mayor-adams-anoints-kathleen-corradi-nyc-s-first-ever-rat-czar-#/0\nhttps://www.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/rats.page"

    "text": "In the years 2020 and 2021, students across the country spent their mornings and early afternoons connecting with their classmates and teachers through zoom, while many of their guardians worked from home, attending meetings and working digitally. It wasn’t a perfect system, though— some had to interrupt to apologize that they couldn’t participate at the moment because the audio keeps cutting, or the internet is too slow. In NYC, a quarter of households— a high percentage being black, hispanic, low-income, and/or senior— lack a broadband subscription. Between 11 and 13 percent of students of the DOE had inadequate internet access during remote learning. What the pandemic taught us, among other things, is that our society relies on the internet and the already marginalized are further disadvantaged by lacking access to it (“Access to Internet in NYC”).\nTo improve these conditions— due in large part to “digital redlining” in which internet service providers exhibit discrimination in internet infrastructure in specific geographic areas, facilitating little competition to compete for customers and, therefore, little affordable service— the mayor’s fund supports the digital inclusion fund and the Office of Technology & innovation launched the NYC Internet Master Plan. The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, who’s found examples of the digital redlining which “put redlined communities at a significant disadvantage in attracting and retaining residents and businesses, compared to better-served neighboring areas” contains the New York fund which “supports a range of non-profit partners to deliver equipment and digital literacy programs, enabling public housing residents to maximize their economic and educational advancement” (“New York Digital Inclusion Fund” and Current Initiatives - Mayor’s Fund).\nThe NYC Internet Master Plan, released to give New Yorkers access to necessary tools for “every facet of their lives, including employment, housing, health, and government services,” led to bills aiming to “provide mobile hotspot devices to public school students, raise awareness of affordable internet programs, and increase transparency around cable franchise agreements” (“New York City to Close Digital Divide for 1.6 Million Residents” and “Access to Internet in NYC”). The plan has, for example, started deployment of fiber-optic internet into two affordable housing complexes, and the website already includes portals to amenities such as childcare tracking, online 311, open data, and a wifi kiosk finder—all of which would be thoroughly difficult to find without internet. It even has vaccine appointment finders, mobile apps for emergency updating, a food donation/receiving finder, a work ticket manager, and a crime reporting tool (NYC Office of Technology and Innovation). Having access to these amenities put people at a significant advantage, so it’s extremely important that the city has initiatives to incentivize and support its inclusion for all its residents.\nWorks Cited (annotated):\n“Access to Internet in NYC.” Data Team, https://council.nyc.gov/data/internet-access/.

    "title": "New York’s Initiative on the Disabled Community",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s close to a million people that have some disability in New York City (NYC Mayor’s office). Disability is defined as a person who has any physical or mental limitations that prevents them from doing daily activities. In the past, disability was unfavored by society- seen as a disease or an inconvenience that was brought on individuals who simply went out living on Earth in different ways. Disabled individuals were often segregated from others who weren’t disabled and were often heavily mistreated for being different. Cases like these happened in places such as the Willowbrook State School (1947) in Staten Island. However in modern day history, New York City seems to strive to make sure that disabled individuals are treated equally and fairly among others especially in classrooms.\nIEP stands for Individualized Education Programs and it is a program that offers disabled students the resources and tools they need to be equally successful in the classroom. In order to apply for the IEP program you must be 18 or under and eligible at least of one of the thirteen conditions. These conditions are listed by the NYC Public School Education Department as follows:\n(New York State Senate)\nEvery student who follows the required conditions in order to qualify for IEP (such as autism, dyslexia, etc.) receive a guided track to their courses and a specialized teacher to assist them if need be. The IEP program benefits all students with disabilities by giving equal and fair access to the education that all other students receive. 1 in 16 students are enrolled in IEP programs at their schools. Students in IEP programs receive updates on their academic reports, suggestions to external disability services, and are encouraged to interact in activities with children without disabilities. This makes it so that the child is treated fairly in a public school system community. There will also be services that provide an IEP student the resources they need to succeed in a standard school environment such as alternative exams procedures to accommodate the needs of those with disabilities.\nThe Free Appropriate Public Education Guidelines or FAPE are rules in the public education system that ensures that every single student is treated fairly in schools with disability or not. This includes students with disabilities being integrated with students without disabilities. These rules make sure that every disabled student is cared for and that they are not isolated from the rest of the public school system because of their condition. It is New York’s main goal overtime for FAPE:\nSETSS stands for the Special Education Teacher Support Services and it provides additional instructional service for students in the IEP to be guided by a paraprofessional or faculty that has a background in special educational services. This program offers what is known as resource rooms provided for students who need additional support in educational services such as “math, reading, or braille ’’ as stated on the Teacher Associations Website. The SETSS program offered what are known as direct or indirect services.\n~Direct Services- provide students with close knit education by having teachers teach cognitive skills and social awareness to disabled students so they don’t struggle as much learning in the classrooms.\n~Indirect services- partnership between the special education teacher and the general education teacher working together to accommodate the needs of the disabled student. Cognitive skill development and social awareness are all taught within the regular classroom.\nNew York City’s goal is to make every student equal both inside and outside of the classroom is increasingly successful. More and more students with disabilities are being treated more fairly, this increases New York City’s goal for more inclusive community with people with disabilities and without."

    "title": "Closed NYC Train Stations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, NYC’s transportation was run by three private corporations: the IRT (Interborough Transit Company), the BMT (Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation) and the IND (Independent Subway System, confusingly). They are part of the reason why there’s so many closed train stations in the city: they became consolidated and run by the city and many routes even became redundant, as they didn’t have to compete with each other at that point. Much of those were demolished to be unusable or simply abandoned and left intact if they didn’t physically hinder the creation of new routes. Those that were demolished for redundancy were mostly elevated lines that had matched routes in underground lines. The rest of the closed stations were usually shuttered because they were close to another station, but some were closed by rare circumstances.\nOne notable station closed due to proximity to other stations was the Court Street Station in Brooklyn, which served as part of the IND’s Fulton Street Line. Being close to other stations in Downtown Brooklyn (which lead to other factors like low ridership and finding transfers obsolete), Court Street Station was abandoned in 1946 ten years after its opening. The soiled walls led the New York City Transit Authority to test a new cleaning method on them in 1960, and sixteen years later this station became home to the New York City Transit Exhibit. Containing preserved subway artifacts, the museum is still open today (now run by the MTA) despite it being planned on closing a year after opening, in 1977.\nSignificant rare circumstances have been present in multiple train station closings. One train station lasted only for a year, and was purpose built for a specific event: the 1939 World Fair. The IND built the Queens station to move people more easily to the fair, but it wasn’t popular since the fare was an extra 5¢, and was demolished when dismantled, not to be reopened in the 1964 Fair. One station that closed and then reopened, though, was the IRT’s Intervale Avenue Station in the Bronx. After a failed robbery of the South Bronx Subway token booth ended in an arson in 1989 (which imitated a previous token robbery in a Brooklyn station, but didn’t kill the clerk), the station was closed until it finished vigorous reconstruction in 1992.\nAnother even more unfortunate event was responded with a train station closure and reopening as well. The IRT’s WTC Cortland Station in Manhattan was under ground zero of the September 11th attacks, and was rebuilt and opened in 2018. However, BMT’s Cortlandt Street Station, which also sustained damage, was closed and rebuilt for a year after 2001, reopened, but then again permanently to make way for the building of Dey Street Passageway and the rebuilding of the World Trade Station."

The organization all started in November 1981 with Gael Greene, a long-time restaurant critic who read about how food services in New York City didn’t work on weekends and holidays. These services being closed affected older New Yorkers’ ability to get food during the weekends. A month later, Greene gathered her friends in the food and hospitality industry; together, they created about 6,000 meals to share with elderly New Yorkers around Christmas time.\nPoverty is a prevalent issue in New York City, especially among the older population. In 2017, A report from the Center for An Urban Future gathered data via survey from the senior population in New York State. The senior population in New York State grew 31%, while the state’s 65-under population decreased by 2%. In New York City, most of the increase in the elder population is due to an aging immigrant population. In regards to poverty levels, New York City’s 65+ community has a poverty rate of 20%. The study also reported higher poverty rates among Latine, Asian, and Black senior communities.\nSince late 1981, City Meals-On-Wheels has strove to deliver food to older New Yorkers in need. They’re open on weekends and most holidays, but on the holidays they do close on, they give out food in advance so that those in need get food. In 2011, the Mobile Food Pantry started so that those who couldn’t walk to get groceries or the meals themselves were delivered the food at their doorstep.\nBesides food, the organization also has programs that support the elderly in other aspects of life. The Friendly Visiting Program addresses the loneliness and isolation issue among the elderly. According to the official City Meals-On-Wheels website, 57% of meal recipients live alone, 40% almost never leave home, and 8% have no one to talk to. The Friendly Visiting Program tackles this by pairing “caring individuals with homebound elderly neighbors in need of companionship.” Each volunteer dedicates an hour a week for at least 6 months, with a flexible schedule determined between the volunteer and their match. Other forms of social service include sending handmade cards for special occasions and making weekly phone calls to meal recipients.\nSince 1981, City Meals-On-Wheels has delivered over 67 million meals to the older NYC population. Their food and social outreach programs make them wonderful support for elderly New Yorkers. City Meals-On-Wheels is a wonderful example of community support and organization that comes together to help a population in need."

    "title": "De Blasio’s Rat Elimination Initiative",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2017, the de Blasio administration announced a $32 million neighborhood rat reduction plan. The plan aimed to reduce rat populations in Lower Manhattan, Bushwick in Brooklyn, and the Grand Concourse area in the Bronx by implementing various strategies such as increased garbage pickup, rat-proof garbage cans, and dry ice extermination. The less obvious, more innovative, and more ethically ambiguous methods such as expanding the use of dry ice extermination and rat birth control stand out. These efforts have been accompanied by community outreach and education programs to help residents better understand how to prevent rat infestations in their neighborhoods.\nIn each of the government reports, the city has emphasized the ways in which rats lead to the spread of disease. One recent study, from the American Society of Microbiology, reported that rats in NYC have tested positive for antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. The delta variant was particularly infectious among rats. There needs to be more research to find out whether rats can give the virus back to humans. However, this among many other data points, highlight the dangers of large rat infestations.\nDespite some skepticism from residents and experts who questioned its effectiveness and the sustainability of its methods, the administration defended the plan, stating that it was a comprehensive effort to address the city’s rat problem. The City reported a 10% reduction in the number of rat sightings in the target neighborhoods.\nFurthermore, a study by Michael G. Walsh in PeerJ found that rat sightings in New York City were associated with neighborhood sociodemographics, housing characteristics, and proximity to open public space. The study concluded that a combination of structural improvements, such as better waste management and building maintenance, and community education and engagement were necessary to effectively control rat populations in the city. Based on these findings, the City has also focused on addressing the root causes of rat infestations, such as poor waste management and inadequate building maintenance, in addition to implementing targeted interventions.\nBefore this improvement initiative, the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice, reported that tracking infrastructure, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), can be used to map and monitor rat sightings and infestations in real-time. This information can be used to identify high-risk areas and develop targeted interventions to prevent and control rat infestations. However, there is no indication on whether method was implemented in the decisions made during de Blasio’s initiative.\nSince de Blasio’s initiative, Mayor Adams has picked up where de Blasio left off in an attempt to further reduce rat populations in NYC. In fact, on April 1st, 2023, a smaller trash time window will be enforced such that trash spends less time on NYC streets where rats can feast.\nOverall, for most New Yorkers, it is probably surprising how much technology, money and resources have been spent on rat reduction. When taken at face value, the issue seems obvious, but not necessarily something to pour millions of dollars into.\n\nSources\n“De Blasio Administration Announces $32 Million Neighborhood Rat Reduction Plan.” The Official Website of the City of New York, 12 July 2017, http://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/472-17/de-blasio-administration-32-million-neighborhood-rat-reduction-plan.\nGoodman, J.

    "title": "Segregation in NYC Public Schools",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Segregation in schools based on neighborhoods has been a deeply rooted issue in New York City, perpetuating inequalities and hindering educational opportunities for marginalized communities. However, in recent years, there have been notable modern-day improvement initiatives aimed at combatting and addressing this problem. We will be examining the historical background of segregation in NYC Schools, learn about current initiatives, highlight success stories, and explore challenges and criticisms.\nTo understand the current state of segregation, it is essential to acknowledge the historical context. Throughout much of the 20th century, NYC schools were subject to various forms of segregation, both legally and in reality. Discriminatory policies and practices, such as redlining and zoning, resulted in racially and socioeconomically homogeneous neighborhoods, which in turn led to segregated schools. Despite efforts to desegregate, the problem persists today.\nAdditionally, NYC has recognized the need to address segregation in specialized high schools. The elimination of single test for admission to these schools is one such initiative. Critics argue that this change lowers academic standards, but proponents maintain that it opens doors for a more diverse student body. By implementing multiple criteria for admission and expanding outreach programs, NYC seeks to create a fairer and more equitable system.\nThere have been numerous success and failure stories that demonstrate these varying initiatives. For instance, the District 1 Diversity Plan and the lack of diversity that occurs in specialized high schools (District 1 is in the lower east side).\nDistrict 1, which is historically known for its stark racial and socioeconomic disparities, took a proactive approach to tackle segregation and promote integration. Under the District 1 Diversity Plan, schools in the district have implemented a range of strategies to increase diversity and create more inclusive learning environments. One of these strategies being, implementing controlled choice enrollment systems, which prioritize student diversity during the admissions process, and establishing shared enrollment systems that allow families to apply to multiple schools within the district. One example of the success of these efforts is the integration achieved at the Earth School. The Earth School, located in District 1, transformed from being a predominantly white and affluent school to a more diverse and inclusive institution. Through intentional admissions policies and community engagement, the Earth School achieved a significant increase in racial and socioeconomics diversity, fostering a more equitable and enriching educational experience for its students.\nHowever, despite progress, challenges and criticisms persist. Some argue that current initiatives fall short of addressing the root causes of segregation, such as residential segregation and unequal school funding. These systemic issues require comprehensive solutions beyond school-level interventions. Critics also caution against diluting academic standards in the pursuit of diversity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high expectations for all students.\nDespite efforts to diversify NYC’s top-tier high schools, the admission rates for Black students remain disproportionately low. The Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT), which serves as the sole criterion for admission to these schools, data revealed that of the students offered seats for the upcoming academic year, only a minute fraction are Black, despite Black students making up a substantial portion of the overall student population in the city’s public schools. In May of 2019, only 7 out of 895 freshman seats available were given to Black students in Stuyvesant High School, 12 out of 803 in Bronx High School of Science, 95 out of 1,825 in Brooklyn Tech, and 1 out of 304 in Staten Island Tech, just to name a few and paint the picture of the blatant pattern. These low admission rates contribute to the perpetuation of racial inequalities and limit educational opportunities for Black students. It is no coincident that Black students are often concentrated in underfunded and under-resourced schools. This underrepresentation in elite high schools exacerbates existing disparities in access to quality education and perpetuates the opportunity gap.\nSources\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/nyregion/black-students-nyc-high-schools.html\nhttps://citylimits.org/2017/11/28/cityviews-city-schools-make-a-downpayment-on-diversity/\nhttps://www.publicschoolreview.com/blog/new-york-city-schools-most-segregated-in-the-nation\nhttps://www.usnews.com/education/k12/new-york/earth-school-213935\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cge/racial-ethnic-enrollment"

    "section": "",
    "text": "On October 26, 2021, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a 425 million dollar project with the Community Parks Initiative (CPI). Within the next ten years CPI guarantees to rebuild up to 10 community parks a year.\nThe Community Parks initiative began in 2014. CPI began by reviewing data on New York City’s park investments from the last 20 years. The data showed that less advantaged communities had underinvested parks. These parks were empty, ruined, and outdated. In response CPI promises to renew these parks, but also connect its community to make sure a healthy environment emerges. CPI encourages communities to contribute by engaging them in the planning process by organizing social gathering events and activities. CPI also has a webpage if members of the community prefer to contribute remotely.\nVan Alst playground located in the borough of Queens was CPI’s first successful project. CPI renovated the children’s playground by giving it a more fun and attractive look, and from that day on, CPI has renewed over 110 community parks across all five boroughs. The initiative focuses on repainting basketball courts, nets, handball courts, fences, remodeling playgrounds, swings, workout equipment, and gardens. Not to mention, CPI also provides service for the health and planning processes of communities.\nThe Community Parks initiative is a very beneficial pathway for New York City because the people practice interconnectedness and safety. Community parks are rarely empty because they are much more approachable and clean. The parks are attractive to people of all ages. It’s a place where people can go out and be active. A place where anyone can meet someone new and get along. The sense of danger is eliminated and parents feel safe having their kids around. As members of the community continue to provide maintenance and service to the park, the safety and interconnectedness status remains active. Applying such a change to underserved communities delivers a message that members of these communities are not forgotten."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Across Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx, Queens, Jersey City, and Hoboken, one could see CitiBike stations scattered throughout. CitiBikes have been a staple of New York City transport since their establishment.\nCitiBikes came from an increased effort in cities worldwide to become more environmentally conscious. Road transport counts for around 30% of global CO2 emissions. With the environmental crisis that we’re currently in, cities are trying to cut down on pollution. The concept of micromobility in particular is rising in popularity. Micromobility refers to a group of lightweight vehicles that can be used as an alternative to vehicular modes of transportation. These vehicles include but are not limited to (e)scooters, (e)bikes, and skateboards. Using these kinds of transport vehicles over cars is considered much more environmentally-friendly, especially when defaulting to micromobility for short-distance trips.\nOne of the initiatives considered by bigger cities are bike sharing programs, in which bikes or e-bikes are made available to the general population. Stations are distributed throughout the city in order to increase accessibility to the bikes themselves. Anyone can easily grab from one station and return it at another. Payment for using the bikes is usually done through mobile applications.\nThese bike systems have been in use since the 1960s. Cities such as Barcelona, Paris, and London all have implemented bike sharing. The first city in North America to establish a bike-sharing system was Washington, DC in August 2008. The NYC CitiBike system was announced in September 2011 and launched in May 2013 with 6000 bikes across Manhattan and Brooklyn. Between 2014 and 2017, the use of CitiBikes saved the equivalent of 13,370 tons of oil.\nAs of now, a single ride for half an hour costs $4.49, with $0.23 per extra minute, and a full day pass is $19. There are also annual passes that cost $17.08 monthly, billed $205 annually. It’s available to rent on the Lyft App or the CitiBike app. CitiBike has over 143,000 annual members, with many more just renting by the day. The CitiBike system is a great method of environmentally-conscious transportation that will benefit New Yorkers and New York City for years to come.\nBecker, Bernie. “Bicycle-Sharing Program to Be First of Kind in U.S.” New York Times, April 27, 2008. https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/us/27bikes.html.\nChen, Yan, et al. “An Environmental Benefit Analysis of Bike Sharing in New York City.” Cities, February 2022. https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275121003747.\nCitiBike. “About Citi Bike,” n.d. https://ride.citibikenyc.com/about.\nNational Association of City Transportation Officials. “Bike Share and Shared Micromobility Initiative,” n.d. https://nacto.org/program/bike-share-initiative/.\nPBSC Urban Solutions. “What Is a Bike Share Program and How Does It Work?” January 17, 2022. https://www.pbsc.com/blog/2022/01/what-is-a-bike-share-program-and-how-does-it-work.\nPrice, Jeff, et al. “Micromobility: A Travel Mode Innovation.” U.S. Department of Transportation, vol. 85, no. 1, Spring 2021, https://highways.dot.gov/public-roads/spring-2021/02."

    "title": "Affordable Housing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The past is very much with us in New York’s Housing Landscape.\nBeginning in the 1820’s and 1830’s, early row houses modeled after English terraces were built to house people who could live where land costs were high, like artisans. Apartment houses only became built a century later, in the 1920’s. Row houses provided what many single family homes have today but at a lower cost. Residents were given privacy, yards and equity. Between 1860 and 1910, tenements were built due to increasing numbers of immigrants coming from Europe with little to no money. By 1900, over half of the 3 million people home to New York City, lived in these low sanitary tenements that were modeled after row houses. Due to the tenements being modeled after row houses, the living conditions or lack thereof, caused rates of disease and morality to soar. The same model of a 25 x 100 foot lot that was originally meant to house 1 to 4 people, was now being used to house 80 to 150 people. They increased the height of the row house to five or six stories, rather than two, three and four stories, like in the original model. Still, there was little air in the rooms and a lack of plumbing. In 1887 and 1889, A.T White (a Brooklyn businessman) constructed apartments that were modeled after London’s philanthropic housing developments. His Home Buildings and then Tower Buildings in Cobble Hill were meant to house the steadily employed, working class family. In light of this, most developers did not accept his projects as models for mass construction of low income housing. However, after some model development, the row house became and remains a popular choice for moderate income families to live in. Yet, not everyone can afford these houses.\nOne solution proposed to combat housing issues in NYC was brought up by Mayor Koch in the 1980’s and focused on neighborhood revitalization. It suggested a 10 year plan that invested $5.1 billion dollars into constructing or rehabilitating more than 180,000 units of housing in various NYC neighborhoods. The 10 year plan targeted extremely depressed neighborhoods that were in desperate need of revitalization. Over 50% of all housing units built and revitalized during the 10 year plan were located in districts of the South Bronx, Harlem, and Central Brooklyn. Besides this, Mayor Koch also adjusted the shelter systems to use barrack-style dormitories instead of comfortable, hotel-like placements. The logic behind this change was that it would let NYC officials differentiate people who depended on housing from those who only wanted a free home but could afford something better. Overall, his solution granted an era of prosperity for New York residents, but it did not last for long.\nFast Forward to 2014, Mayor De Blasio came up with another solution for inaffordable housing. The same vacant lots that had been used for housing development in the 1920’s and so forth by A.T White and other builders, were now being sold to non-profit and for profit developers across the 5 burroughs. In association with 596 acres, a non-profit organization which advocates for the transformation of vacant lots into areas of green spaces and for civic engagement, De Blasio is selling these lots so they can build community. The vacant lots, now being sold as One Dollar Lots, were most prominently in the Bronx and Brooklyn. The Bronx continues to be a burrough that has been neglected and its people - forgotten to be taken care of.\nTo combat this neglec, Housing Court in the Bronx is a group of people who are fighting eviction and insufferable living conditions. There is a surplus of rodents and roaches, all while there is a continuous rising interest in housing. Although this is an issue most concentrated in the Bronx, it is an issue across all 5 boroughs. In August 2022, average rent in Manhattan went up to $5,246 from $4,094. That is a 28% increase. In 2010, the Department of City Planning estimated that by 2030, NYC would have a population of 8.8 million people, yet NYC has reached that number almost 10 years earlier, which means housing production is very far behind. Residents are low-income and cannot afford rent. People who want to move here have nowhere to live. According to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, apartments renting for between $801 and $1,499 is just 0.9%. Where are people who cannot afford beyond this number supposed to live?\nThe current solution proposed by Mayor Adams in 2022 is the “Get Stuff Built” solution. He has the goal to produce over 500,000 new homes over the next decade. He wishes to partner with New York State, the New York City Council, and New Yorkers in all five boroughs to complete this. He also wants to lower the cost of development by accelerating project timelines by 50%. His goal is to be efficient and to create affordable housing. The three points he presents are to Build Faster, Build everywhere, and Build together. Prohibiting exclusionary zoning practices, speeding up the pre-certification process, and reducing or eliminating unnecessary parking requirements that add cost and reduce the number of homes being built are just some of the steps he plans to take.\nUnaffordable housing has made New York almost unlivable. Perhaps that’ll finally change.\nFrishberg, Hannah. “New Map Shows Every City-Owned Lot Sold for $1 since de Blasio Became Mayor.” Curbed NY, March 13, 2018. https://ny.curbed.com/2018/3/13/17115052/new-york-city-owned-land-lots-interactive-map.\nGardner, Deborah. “Notes on New York’s Housing History.” The Architectural League of New York, February 28, 2018. https://archleague.org/article/new-york-housing/.\n“Mayor Adams Unveils ‘Get Stuff Built,’ Bold Three-Pronged Strategy to Tackle Affordable Housing Crisis, Sets ‘Moonshot’ Goal of 500,000 New Homes.” The official website of the City of New York, December 8, 2022. https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/893-22/mayor-adams-get-stuff-built-bold-three-pronged-strategy-tackle-affordable-housing#/0.\nNgo, Emily. “In New York City, Housing Supply Continues to Fail to Meet Demand.” In New York City, housing supply fails to meet demand, October 10, 2022. https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/housing/2022/10/07/new-york-city-housing-supply-demand.\nSchill, Michael H., Ingrid Gould Ellen, Amy Ellen Schwartz, and Ioan Voicu.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Life of Street Vendors\nStreet vendors risk their lives everyday to support their families in the country and even to send money outside the US. Street vendors work hard long hours just to earn the minimum wage. Beside all this, street vendors go through police brutality, injustice and their rights are barely existing. According to the Guardian, “Cops slap vendors with tickets that can eat up half their take-home pay.” This quote suggests that some officers take advantage of their power to ruin the life of the least fortunate people, especially the illegal community. A lot of the street vendors are illegal, and their only source is selling clothes, food, and other items in the streets. However, how can their success be possible if their fear of getting a ticket that can cost them 8+ hours of work, assaulted by a police officer or even arrested is bigger than their dream to be better.\nStreet vendors went to the pressure of watching what they do and how they do it due to the extreme rules they had to follow. Again from the guardian, “In 2015, the city’s environmental control board wrote 18,744 vending violation tickets.” This quote illustrates that the smallest mistake a street vendor made could have cost them half of their wage. Nonetheless, people such as Osama Khatlan who wore a cape of tickets with offenses and ridiculous reasons, helped to protest and protect the rights of himself and the other street workers. In addition, Khatlan addressed a diverse audience, including a West African handbag vendor, a Chinese street artist, a Latina vendor and a few organizers. They moved toward downtown to the cries of “vendor power!” and the wave of flags. Nevertheless, the fight for these rights doesn’t stop there.\nThe City Council approved a law in 2021 that increased the availability of food vendor permits, created an office of street vendor enforcement, and formed a street vendor advisory board in July last year. NYC food policy illustrates, “the number of food street vending licenses will be raised every year for the following ten, through 2032, by 445. The overall number of available units will ultimately double as a result.” This demonstrates that futures vendors are able to obtain a peaceful way to a successful business. Although the fights against these injustices are showing good results, the fight is not over. The number of Mobile Food Vending Permits that may be issued to food trucks and carts is capped by City legislation, but the number of Mobile Food Vending Licenses is not constrained. Long waitlists for permits (some of which have been closed for more than a decade) and an unofficial black market for permits emerge from this. Some vendors have paid a permit holder up to $20,000 to illegitimately sublease them. To finalize, the smallest enterprises in New York State, street vendors play a crucial role in the economy and cultural landscape of New York City. Around 20,000 business owners, mostly immigrants, people of color, veterans, and women, work as street vendors. Many of them are part of a shadow economy made up of people who are unable to obtain the business licenses they need to legally operate their company."

    "text": "In the 19th century, NYC began to expand into the “The Big Apple” we know today. With an influx of European immigrants and a bustling city, engineers looked to an undergound solution that could sustain quick and efficient transportation; more effective than horse-drawn carriages and better than elevated trains pulled by steam locomotives above ground. The city’s first subway opened in 1870 and was a short underground tunnel measuring 312 feet beneath Broadway that stretched from Warren Street to Murray street, near City Hall. The first train was an eight foot long car that in theory, could carry 18 passengers and was mobilized by 100 horsepower. Although it was an impressive engineering feat, it was left as a short-lived public demonstration. Due to the Panic of 1873, a stock market crash in Europe that affected European’s investments of American railroads, the first subway of 1870 was a project that could no longer be supported. In 1897 however, the Treemont Street Subway in Boston was the first subway in the United States. This streetcar line inspired New York City to re-begin construction on their rapid transit system. The first subway line opened on October 27th, 1904 and had four tracks with express stations located approximately 1.5 miles apart at Brooklyn Bridge, 14th Street, Grand Central, 72nd Street, and 96th Street, with local stations spread apart about a quarter of a mile away from eachother. The ASCE’s Board of Directors voted in 1977 to declare NYC’s first subway as a National Historic Civil Engineering landmark. Yes, NYC’s subway was an incredibly impressive and unique engineering accomplishment. However, what engineers failed to take into consideration when building these efficient and comfortable modes of transportation, was the safety of its passengers.\nAlthough the engineers managed to make efficient train systems, they focused more on the engineering aspects of the railways and less on the makeup of each train car. This is something that would cause problems, even today. The New York Times wrote that there was a 22 per cent increase in crime in 2022 compared to 2021. A lot of these crimes occur on the subway. According to the Gothamist, a non-profit newsroom, grand larcenies plummeted in 2020, early in the pandemic. This was due to there being less subway riders, which meant less phones to steal and people to corner. However, now that there are more people returning to NYC’s subways, crime rates are continuing to rise again. To combat this, Mayor Eric Adams and Gov. Kathy Hochul have ordered an additional 1200 NYC officers to patrol the train stations. However, there still needs to be a solution for riders safety within the train cars. An MTA survery from August 2022 found that only 54 per cent of riders felt safe on trains and nearly 70 per cent felt that there were not enough police in the subway system. Due to a lack of safety, there has been a decrease in subway riders, even though numbers are beginning to climb again. The MTA hopes to reach 1.3 billion riders a year in 2026. In 2015 however, there were 1.8 billion riders a year.\nThe first step NYC can take to increase the number of subway riders again is to improve the train system. The new R211 trains are the first new subway cars to join the city’s train car system in five years. The MTA is investing over 6 billion dollars. The R211 cars will first be put on the A line and will feature wider doors that are 58 inches wide, compared to the previous 50 inch doors. This is supposed to reduce station stop times by 32 per cent. There have been 1,200 new R211 cars ordered, which costed nearly $3.2 billion dollars. Besides wider doors, the new trains will also feature open gateways to allow passengers to easily move between each car; something that is common on major European subways like London and Paris. The cars will also have cameras inside to increase public safety, alongside the police officers that Mayor Adams ordered to patrol the stations.\nBascome, Erik. “MTA Hosts Inaugural Ride on Brand New R211 Subway Cars.” silive, March 10, 2023. https://www.silive.com/news/2023/03/mta-hosts-inaugural-ride-on-brand-new-r211-subway-cars.html.\n“Committees.” ASCE Metropolitan Section.

    "title": "Housing Shortages",
    "section": "",
    "text": "AIA New York Conference to Tackle New York City’s Housing Crisis\nHousing shortage has become a problem in New York City over the past couple of decades. Every borough has been affected by this problem. This has occurred because the population of New York City is increasing every single year. The population has exceeded the expectations of the past. Housing shortage has affected many people because the rent is going up and low-income families can’t afford those rental households.\n\nThe Global Housing Crisis: A Crisis Unlike Any Other - Urbanet\nThere are many statistics that convey how horrible the housing shortage is for low income families. Statistics from National Low Income Housing Coalition(NLIHC) show that only 28% of rental households are extremely low-income. That goes to show that low income families are struggling to survive because the supply is lower than the demand. In addition, 73% of extremely low income renters are struggling because of the severe cost burden. This goes to show that most of low income families can’t really live because they are living paycheck to paycheck. With the population growing at a fast rate it will only be harder for those families.\n\nMore than 500,000 apartments are needed to accommodate the population growth by 2030. Spectrum News suggests that the average rent in Manhattan since August 2022 is $5,246. These details show that the population is growing rapidly and the price of rental apartments are increasing. Also, the vacancy rate for low-income apartments are 0.9%. That means that many low-income rental apartments are pretty much filled. These details show that housing shortages are an increasing problem.\nAccording to Multifamily Loans, New York is the number one metro area with the most housing shortages. It is stated that three quarters of New York’s apartments are more than four decades old. That’s around 1.7 million old units. This implies that renovations are also apart of the problem. Also the housing would have maintenance for multiple years so the cost only piling up even more. Unless people are moved out, that will probably leave people homeless and the rent will probably go up because of the renovation/rebuild.\nThe housing shortages also tie in with homelessness because people are getting evicted, therefore leaving them homeless. More than 70,000 people are sleeping in shelters and that number is going to add up with the housing shortage. Eviction court filings doubled since 2021. This conveys that the housing shortages are leaving people in shelters or on the street. The rent is increasing and people don’t have the money to keep up with it.\nNew York has the lowest homeownership rate out of the all country in 2021. New York is at the bottom with 55.4% of homeownership. Also in New York the city has the lowest precent of homeownership compared to the rest of the state. Each borough have under 45% of homeownership while the rest of the state have 54% or up. This shows that many people in the city of New York don’t own much property.\nAll in all, the housing shortages are a problem that need to be dealt with. There are a couple of ways that this problem can be improved. One way is to increase the housing units made for low-income families. Most of New York are low-income, and not tending to their needs show the lack of care from the state. Another solution is to create programs that help the unfortunate into housing. Also housing should be made on vacant properties or underused public spaces or private spaces.\n\n\nNational Low Income Housing Coalition. “New York.” Accessed March 27, 2023.https://nlihc.org/housing-needs-by-state/new-york.\nMultifamily Loans. “Top 10 Metros With the Largest Housing Shortages.” Accessed March 26, 2023.https://www.multifamily.loans/apartment-finance-blog/top-10-metros-with-the-largest-housing-shortages/.\n“In New York City, Housing Supply Continues to Fail to Meet Demand.” Accessed March 26, 2023.https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/housing/2022/10/07/new-york-city-housing-supply-demand.\nOffice of the New York State Comptroller. “Homeownership Rates in New York.” Accessed March 26, 2023.https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/homeownership-rates-new-york.\nABC7 New York. “Eviction ‘floodgate’ Has Opened in NYC Due to Rising Rents, End of Pandemic Era Rental Aid,” February 15, 2023.https://abc7ny.com/housing-crisis-evictions-affordable-rent/12820437/."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Who are Women in Need? Well, this organization started in 1983 when a group of women that decided to call themselves “Women in Need”open a shelter for four woman and their kids, with the help of the Church of St. Mary.After realizing the needs that many women had around that time Win decided to open another shelter, but this time in Brooklyn called”Monica House”, three years after they open another homeless house in the Bronx called Casa Rita for 16 families. In 1987 Win opened Alexander Abraham Residence for 31 families also in Manhattan and two other home shelter in the Bronx in 1989. Win is the largest shelter giver. You might be asking yourself, what do they do? Or how many people they have helped? Something interesting about this organization is that Win has fourth teen shelters around the borough that provide house to more than 1000 women in need and their Childs every day. This website illustrates, “4,800 people are houses by WIN, each night including over 2700 children”. This shows this shows that the organization contains a wide range of homeless people helpers that offer a better life to all these women and their families. Among the services provided are case management, support, and long-term residential housing. Case managers who deal with clients make house calls and have regular office hours. Case management services can also include crisis intervention, job training and workforce readiness counseling, education counseling, assistance with budgeting and other financial literacy skills, and referrals to programs for physical and/or mental health difficulties, depending on the client.\nAdditionally, Win is also recognized because they offer traditional and temporary houses for the homeless women they attend.“ClearPath”demonstrates that, “nearly 10% of homeless families in New York City are housed by WIN.” This only shows that Win gives homeless families in New York City the comprehensive support they need to thrive on their own, including safe homes, vital resources, and ground-breaking initiatives. As a result, these families reclaim their independence, and their children may look forward to a better future. NYC DHS expresses that, The Housing Assistance Program, an anti-eviction initiative aimed at a high-risk zip code in the Bronx, was developed and implemented with Win’s help as a significant partner in recent years. This involvement with DHS’s homelessness prevention initiatives has increased. This demonstrates that they not only work alone to improve the community, but also collaborate with other organizations to make their impact better. To end the cycle of homelessness and shorten the time that people spend living in shelters, Win is advocating for changes that will assist New York families in finding and maintaining permanent homes. The thousands of families and kids who are experiencing homelessness will have more housing stability thanks to these actions, which will significantly reduce instability and enhance outcomes. By updating the city’s Family Intake procedure and establishing a shelter development fund for reputable charity providers, you can make sure that families in need may get the resources they need for refuge. Increase the quantity of rental aid vouchers available to families and enforce the fair housing legislation. Provide families the resources they need to keep a permanent home, such as childcare subsidies, 18 months of aftercare, and routes to respectable work."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the wake of an international pandemic that shut down the entire country, a lot of mental health issues began to arise. While necessary to keep people from getting sick, the several years of isolation from quarantine created a negative impact on people’s mental health. To address the impact that the pandemic quarantine had on people, the New York City Council established the Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health back in December of 2021. Amending the City Charter, the new service would work towards progress in helping New Yorkers dealing with mental health issues.\nSince his induction into serving in 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams released an agenda to further the support for mental health. His agenda, “Care, Community, Action: A Mental Health Plan for New York City”, would further support resources that aid in mental health. This includes programs for youth suicide or launching telehealth programs for high school students. The program also aims towards overdose prevention, hoping to reduce overdose deaths fifteen percent by the year 2025. The agenda’s final goal is for serious mental illness treatment, and would allow greater connections to facilities that aid in that department. Mayor Adams plans on investing $20 million towards this program\nAnother plan of Mayor Adam’s to address mental health issues is to give aid to people whose mental health issues are not being cared for. From NYC Mayor’s Office of Community Mental Health’s website:\n“Measures in Mayor Adams’ legislative agenda announced today include:\n\nMaking the law explicit that a person requires care when their mental illness prevents them from meeting their own basic needs;\nMandating that hospital clinicians consider a range of factors when assessing a patient’s need for involuntary admission or retention, including known treatment history and current ability to adhere to outpatient treatment;\nRequiring hospitals to screen all psychiatric patients prior to discharge for their need to receive “assisted outpatient treatment” (court-ordered care under “Kendra’s Law”);\nAllowing a broader range of trained mental health professionals to perform evaluations and community removals of individuals in crisis; and\nRequiring hospitals to notify known community providers when their clients are admitted or released and collaborate with community providers in preparing patients for discharge.”\n\nThis measure would be applied citywide, so while it was announced at a meeting in Albany, it would still impact New Yorkers within the five boroughs. The biggest concern these plans bring up is that police would be given too much control over people. They would be able to forcibly move people they deem mentally unwell into the places created by these programs. In particular, homeless people face frequent harassment from the police, and these policies enable this further.\nThe impact that the pandemic had on the general mental health of the people cannot be understated. But New Yorkers are working for ways to improve these conditions for the better.\nSources:\nPolicies and Practices to Support Undergraduate Teaching Improvement | American Academy of Arts and Sciences\n\nEvery Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)"

One goal is to become familiar with research methods used in the social sciences to ask and answer complex issues about people and society. Individual segments of the course are structured around specific methods. Another goal is to use digital technology to facilitate and share our research findings and process. This course will introduce you to many research technologies that will help you throughout your undergraduate experience, and helpful notes about using these tools will be uploaded to the compendium across the semester.

The structure and grading of the assignments may change through our conversation and discovery process, and those changes and new agreements will always be updated and reflected here.\nTo provide a brief overview, each week will involve readings from a variety of sources, including the textbook. All readings other than the textbook will be provided on blackboard. Our class meets two times per week on Mondays and Wednesdays.\nWeekly assignments may vary, but will generally take the form of blog posts. Students will be shown how to set-up a personal blog, and will contribute notes to the blog as a way to engage with course content. Students are strongly encouraged to be as creative as possible when “Blogging” this course, and class time will be spent on learning how to maximise the usefulness of blogging to substantially enhance engagement with content.\n\nFinal Project\nThe final project will involve writing our very own “People’s Guide to NYC”, and then sharing it online as website and online book.

Each student will be responsible for writing five of their own vignettes about the people of NYC. The topic of the vignettes will be researched across the semester.

You may be able to work ahead, but you are not encouraged to fall behind.\nYou should email me if you have an exceptional circumstance preventing you from participating in class.\n\n\nChanges to the syllabus\nThe syllabus may be updated for clarity or to make adjustments for pedagogical purposes. The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\nMissing an Exam\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nEmail Correspondence\nI will regularly use e-mail via blackboard to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.\nIf you have questions please email me:\n\nput Seminar 2 in your subject line\nemail me at: mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu\n\n\n\nGeneral Help with Research and Writing\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for implementing that policy can be found at this site. If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation.\n\n\nFYI on cheating etc.\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CUNY’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\nMandate to report violations\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office."

I’ve written textbooks that can be shared as web-books, pdfs, or ebooks, and I used quarto for that too. You can write slide-decks, and whole academic papers, and many other things with quarto. Quarto can also seamlessly integrate regular text with computer code, so you can create interactive documents, interactive web-apps, data-analytic dashboards, and many more things.\nThe quarto process I use relies on a combination of other tools, such as the programming language R, a user-interface to R called Rstudio, and a cloud-based hosting option for sharing everything online (I use github.com, which also provides version control and allows me to share source code and webpages). Teaching all of these tools are way beyond the scope of this class.\nHowever, quarto makes many things easy, and it is possible to use the platform without much prior experience with coding. It also opens the door to learning new skills that could be very useful to you in the future.\nAs we get moving along, I will be encouraging each of you to create a personal website and blog.

In conversations with faculty, students and ITFs/TLCs, we’ve moved towards a slight modification to that title. “The People of New York City” more accurately reflects the content the course should cover. Immigration is not an unqualified positive story, and the story of the people of New York includes indigenous populations (past and present), as well as those whose ancestors (near or far) were brought to New York without choosing to come voluntarily. Questions of gentrification, race, culture, gender, homelessness, inequality, education, cultural appropriation (and more) can all be part of the content of this course, and the narratives that the course pursues are complex and multifaceted.’\n“This is an interdisciplinary course, and should be taught as such. It is not a history course, a sociology course, or an anthropology course, but it often has elements of all of those fields. It should not be seen as an introductory course to any specific field, but instead a cross-disciplinary examination of the ways that different areas in the social sciences might approach the same content area. The course should provide some comparison of different approaches in every individual section. Sociology, anthropology, history, political science, geography, demographics (and more) are all welcome, but no single one of these areas should be the sole focus of the course.”"
