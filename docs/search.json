    "text": "Seminar 2: The People of New York City\nThis is the course website for Seminar 2: The People of New York City, taught by Dr. Matthew Crump in Spring 2023, for the Macaulay Honor’s program at Brooklyn College of CUNY. This website is currently under development\nCatalogue Description: In this seminar, students use tools from the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums and historical and cultural sites across the city.\nCourse Description: In this seminar, students use the tools of the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Seminar topics include: the experiences of Indigenous and enslaved populations; the ongoing consequences of settler colonialism; the ways in which culture, class, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, xenophobia, and racism have shaped New Yorkers’ experiences with and within the city; the formation and social organization of New York’s communities; the impact of successive waves of newcomers to the city on urban culture and politics; and the continuing debates over assimilation, cultural retention, and “Americanization.” Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums, and historical and cultural sites across the city and the use of demographic, population and other quantitative data as well as qualitative approaches. All classes create public-facing final projects, documenting their research and presenting an aspect of New York City’s diversity.\nLearning Goals/Outcomes: Students will:\n\nDemonstrate a comparative understanding of different populations through research and writing about one or more groups or about an area of the city and its shifting population across time.\nUse a variety of approaches (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, or experiential) to studying people in order to come to an understanding of the diversity of people’s experiences in and of the city.\nUnderstand the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and methodologies used by the social sciences.\nIncrease their understanding of past and present issues including colonialism, migration, immigration, race, and ethnicity by analyzing a variety of sources (current, historical, primary, secondary) and by engaging in active discussion about those issues.\nPresent their research to a public audience through a final project that may be completed by small groups or the entire class.\nCritically examine their own roles in and effect on the communities of New York City."

    "text": "It’s been a couple weeks since my last post. The reading for week 2 was the chapter on The Bronx (Bank Muñoz, Lewis, and Molina 2022). The monday class session involved students pairing up in groups of 2 or 3, choosing one site from the reading, and working together to create a 3-minute class presentation about the site for the following Wednesday class. We talked as a class about goals for presentation content and style, and keeping everything within 3 minutes. The Wednesday class involved about 10 presentations, with time after each one for questions and and comments. This was a lively week with excellent participation and presentations.\nThe assignment for week 3 had two components: sign up for a free account at notion.so, then read through the Manhattan chapter and take notes about sites that were interesting and put your notes into notion.\nWhat is notion? A bunch of things. It’s a cloud-based productivity app with many features. It’s really simple to use a text editor. Everything is based on making “pages” that you can put things into, just like any word-processor. It’s possible to put pages within pages, most types of media, and even inline databases. There are many integrations with other web apps. Notion pages can be shared on the internet with a single click. And, it is possible to create teamspaces, where multiple people can work together. Kind of like group editing a google doc, but with a different feature set.\nIt’s now week 4, and the class is moved onto notion. We will likely stay working there for the semester, and then archive our work publicly at the end.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBank Muñoz, Carolina, Penny Lewis, and Emily Tumpson Molina. 2022.

    "text": "This is a retrospective contribution. The blog part of this website was created on February 2nd. The class was held on Wednesday, January, 25th.\nMy goal for the first class was to meet everyone and give some overview of the goals for the course.\nThe room was too small and too hot. We we went around the room introduced ourselves. I asked everyone to share something about what they learned in the first Macaulay seminar, which was focused on Art in NYC.\nI introduced the concept of the final project and described a few different digital technologies we would learn about throughout the course. Some of the tech tools like notion, zotero, and quarto were since added to the compendium. A full description of the final project has not been produced yet, but will become available as the class narrows down on its goals through discussion.\nThe major assignment was to read the introduction of our textbook (Bank Muñoz, Lewis, and Molina 2022) and be prepared to discuss it for next class."

    "text": "Behind the scenes organizational stuff\nThis is my first time teaching Seminar 2. I usually teach cognition and statistics related courses. Another first is using notion.so to organize the course.\nThis course website and blog is being written using quarto, but notion is where most of the planning is happening.\nNotion has a lot to offer, and I’m barely scratching the surface. I have a single document for this course in notion, and this contains all sorts of other notion pages and collected notes. Inline databases are the most useful feature for course organization.\nThe inline database is great for creating a schedule because it has a calendar view making it easy to select individual dates for each class. It’s possible to export the database as markdown and csv, which made it easy to pop into the syllabus.\n\nThe most interesting part is the ability to add notion pages inside pages, and inside of database entries. For example, the entry for January 30th has a notion page, which is showing up on the right-hand side of the screen. This is a useful location to write class notes, announcements, brainstorm possible activities for next class, and generally link organizational material to specific classes. If I end up teaching this class again, I can come back and see what was happening on a class-by-class basis. I liked notion so much that I’m using it to organize all my other classes."

Readings will generally be assigned on Wednesday for discussion on Monday. This gives more days to complete the readings. Wednesday can be some discussion overflow, but mostly for in-class work-shopping.\nThe textbook is one general reading goal for the semester, and there are several others as well that will be provided on blackboard. The non-textbook readings are not yet announced because they are TBD through our class discussions. The advantage is the readings can be responsive to the dynamics of our discussion. The disadvantage is that no one can read ahead if they don’t know what we might read besides the textbook.\nI’m rapidly developing a solution in the form of a shared zotero library. This library will contain all the additional readings, as well as suggested readings, and class researched materials. The zotero library should be available mid-February or earlier."

The groups had 5 minutes to discuss a prompt. After discussion each group leader reported back a summary of the group discussion to the whole class. For the next discussion prompt, the group chose a new leader who would report back to the class. Some of our discussion prompts were:\n\nGet to know each other for 5 minutes (totally unstructured)\nWhat did you find interesting about the reading?\nWhat guidelines should we keep in mind for having productive, mindful and constructive conversations.\nLet’s talk about your reading process. What did you do as you read this chapter? What was your process?\nBased on the reading as a whole, what is/are the purpose(s) of this book?\n\nThe intro had four major sections, and the last discussion prompt was for each group to take one section and discuss it, and then report back. We ran out of time on this one, and took a paragraph-by-paragraph approach in the next class."

My plan was to make sure everyone was contributing as much as possible. I found it difficult to listen and search for boxes to check at the same time, so I stopped tracking this.\nI remember seeing a discussion tracking activity somewhere that could be an alternative. It looked something like this:\nEach person gets a sheet of paper, and as the group has a discussion the members trace lines show who spoke. The paper keeps a record of turn taking. We might try this at some point to see how it lands."

Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums and historical and cultural sites across the city.\nCourse Description: In this seminar, students use the tools of the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Seminar topics include: the experiences of Indigenous and enslaved populations; the ongoing consequences of settler colonialism; the ways in which culture, class, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, xenophobia, and racism have shaped New Yorkers’ experiences with and within the city; the formation and social organization of New York’s communities; the impact of successive waves of newcomers to the city on urban culture and politics; and the continuing debates over assimilation, cultural retention, and “Americanization.”\nExtensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums, and historical and cultural sites across the city and the use of demographic, population and other quantitative data as well as qualitative approaches. All classes create public-facing final projects, documenting their research and presenting an aspect of New York City’s diversity.\n\nLearning Goals/Outcomes\nStudents will:\n\nDemonstrate a comparative understanding of different populations through research and writing about one or more groups or about an area of the city and its shifting population across time.\nUse a variety of approaches (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, or experiential) to studying people in order to come to an understanding of the diversity of people’s experiences in and of the city.\nUnderstand the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and methodologies used by the social sciences.\nIncrease their understanding of past and present issues including colonialism, migration, immigration, race, and ethnicity by analyzing a variety of sources (current, historical, primary, secondary) and by engaging in active discussion about those issues.\nPresent their research to a public audience through a final project that may be completed by small groups or the entire class.\nCritically examine their own roles in and effect on the communities of New York City."

You can expect that the early weeks of this class will involve class discussions about “how” we will accomplish the goals of this class.\nSome of the general expectations for this class are set forth on the class website in the compendium:\nhttps://crumplab.com/peopleofnyc/compendium/Seminar_2_general_info.html\nOur class will attempt to weave through several different goals. One goal is to become familiar with research methods used in the social sciences to ask and answer complex issues about people and society. Individual segments of the course are structured around specific methods. Another goal is to use digital technology to facilitate and share our research findings and process. This course will introduce you to many research technologies that will help you throughout your undergraduate experience, and helpful notes about using these tools will be uploaded to the compendium across the semester. A last major goal is to create a public-facing expression of our work as a class. To this end, we are going to produce our own student-authored, web-based version of the course textbook, complete with suggested walking tours. More on that throughout the semester."

All readings other than the textbook will be provided on blackboard. Our class meets two times per week on Mondays and Wednesdays.\nWeekly assignments may vary, but will generally take the form of blog posts. Students will be shown how to set-up a personal blog, and will contribute notes to the blog as a way to engage with course content. Students are strongly encouraged to be as creative as possible when “Blogging” this course, and class time will be spent on learning how to maximise the usefulness of blogging to substantially enhance engagement with content.\n\nFinal Project\nThe final project will involve writing our very own “People’s Guide to NYC”, and then sharing it online as website and online book. The model for the final project is our textbook. The textbook is organized as a series of short vignettes about people and places in NYC. Each student will be responsible for writing five of their own vignettes about the people of NYC. The topic of the vignettes will be researched across the semester.

You may be able to work ahead, but you are not encouraged to fall behind.\nYou should email me if you have an exceptional circumstance preventing you from taking an assessment during an assessment week.\n\n\nChanges to the syllabus\nThe syllabus may be updated for clarity or to make adjustments for pedagogical purposes. The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\nMissing an Exam\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nEmail Correspondence\nI will regularly use e-mail via blackboard to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements. I will use the e-mail address you have listed with the College. Therefore, please make sure that this is indeed the correct address.\nIf you have questions please email me:\n\nput Seminar 2 in your subject line\nemail me at: mcrump@brooklyn.cuny.edu\n\n\n\nGeneral Help with Research and Writing\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both. The complete text of the CUNY Academic Integrity Policy and the Brooklyn College procedure for implementing that policy can be found at this site. If a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation.\n\n\nFYI on cheating etc.\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CUNY’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\nMandate to report violations\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students who violate the academic integrity will receive a Faculty Action Report, which will go on their personal file at the Academic Integrity Office."

I’ve written textbooks that can be shared as web-books, pdfs, or ebooks, and I used quarto for that too. You can write slide-decks, and whole academic papers, and many other things with quarto. Quarto can also seamlessly integrate regular text with computer code, so you can create interactive documents, interactive web-apps, data-analytic dashboards, and many more things.\nThe quarto process I use relies on a combination of other tools, such as the programming language R, a user-interface to R called Rstudio, and a cloud-based hosting option for sharing everything online (I use github.com, which also provides version control and allows me to share source code and webpages). Teaching all of these tools are way beyond the scope of this class.\nHowever, quarto makes many things easy, and it is possible to use the platform without much prior experience with coding. It also opens the door to learning new skills that could be very useful to you in the future.\nAs we get moving along, I will be encouraging each of you to create a personal website and blog.

    "text": "Course Description\nIn this seminar, students use the tools of the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Seminar topics include: the experiences of Indigenous and enslaved populations; the ongoing consequences of settler colonialism; the ways in which culture, class, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, xenophobia, and racism have shaped New Yorkers’ experiences with and within the city; the formation and social organization of New York’s communities; the impact of successive waves of newcomers to the city on urban culture and politics; and the continuing debates over assimilation, cultural retention, and “Americanization.” Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums, and historical and cultural sites across the city and the use of demographic, population and other quantitative data as well as qualitative approaches. All classes create public-facing final projects, documenting their research and presenting an aspect of New York City’s diversity."

    "section": "More context for Seminar 2",
    "text": "More context for Seminar 2\nFaculty who teach seminar 2 receive information packets about this seminar. I am sharing some of this info here to provide more context for the course.\n‘The course was originally titled “The Peopling of New York City,” and focused on patterns of immigration as well as neighborhood constitution and dynamics. In conversations with faculty, students and ITFs/TLCs, we’ve moved towards a slight modification to that title. “The People of New York City” more accurately reflects the content the course should cover. Immigration is not an unqualified positive story, and the story of the people of New York includes indigenous populations (past and present), as well as those whose ancestors (near or far) were brought to New York without choosing to come voluntarily. Questions of gentrification, race, culture, gender, homelessness, inequality, education, cultural appropriation (and more) can all be part of the content of this course, and the narratives that the course pursues are complex and multifaceted.’\n“This is an interdisciplinary course, and should be taught as such. It is not a history course, a sociology course, or an anthropology course, but it often has elements of all of those fields. It should not be seen as an introductory course to any specific field, but instead a cross-disciplinary examination of the ways that different areas in the social sciences might approach the same content area. The course should provide some comparison of different approaches in every individual section. Sociology, anthropology, history, political science, geography, demographics (and more) are all welcome, but no single one of these areas should be the sole focus of the course.”"

    "text": "The common project\n“The course requires a public-facing project of some kind from all students. Many sections have produced a website detailing their research on a neighborhood or an immigrant group (or some other topic). You can find many examples on the TLC site. A website project remains a very strong and effective way of fulfilling the public-facing project requirement of the course, especially during distance learning. There are other alternatives, such as videos, that some classes have experimented with. Those projects still need an online presence as a way of being shared and publicly accessible.”\nExamples of past projects can be seen in the Seminar 2 encyclopedia.\nWe will be discussing and developing our own common project throughout the semester that will, at a minimum, involve developing a website to present a public-facing expression of our seminar 2 activities."
