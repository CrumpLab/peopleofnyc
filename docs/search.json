    "text": "Seminar 2: The People of New York City\nThis is the course website for Seminar 2: The People of New York City, taught by Dr. Matthew Crump in Spring 2023, for the Macaulay Honor’s program at Brooklyn College of CUNY. This website is currently under development\nCatalogue Description: In this seminar, students use tools from the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums and historical and cultural sites across the city.\nCourse Description: In this seminar, students use the tools of the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Seminar topics include: the experiences of Indigenous and enslaved populations; the ongoing consequences of settler colonialism; the ways in which culture, class, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, xenophobia, and racism have shaped New Yorkers’ experiences with and within the city; the formation and social organization of New York’s communities; the impact of successive waves of newcomers to the city on urban culture and politics; and the continuing debates over assimilation, cultural retention, and “Americanization.” Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums, and historical and cultural sites across the city and the use of demographic, population and other quantitative data as well as qualitative approaches. All classes create public-facing final projects, documenting their research and presenting an aspect of New York City’s diversity.\nLearning Goals/Outcomes: Students will:\n\nDemonstrate a comparative understanding of different populations through research and writing about one or more groups or about an area of the city and its shifting population across time.\nUse a variety of approaches (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, or experiential) to studying people in order to come to an understanding of the diversity of people’s experiences in and of the city.\nUnderstand the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and methodologies used by the social sciences.\nIncrease their understanding of past and present issues including colonialism, migration, immigration, race, and ethnicity by analyzing a variety of sources (current, historical, primary, secondary) and by engaging in active discussion about those issues.\nPresent their research to a public audience through a final project that may be completed by small groups or the entire class.\nCritically examine their own roles in and effect on the communities of New York City."

    "text": "It’s been a couple weeks since my last post. The reading for week 2 was the chapter on The Bronx (Bank Muñoz, Lewis, and Molina 2022). The monday class session involved students pairing up in groups of 2 or 3, choosing one site from the reading, and working together to create a 3-minute class presentation about the site for the following Wednesday class. We talked as a class about goals for presentation content and style, and keeping everything within 3 minutes. The Wednesday class involved about 10 presentations, with time after each one for questions and and comments. This was a lively week with excellent participation and presentations.\nThe assignment for week 3 had two components: sign up for a free account at notion.so, then read through the Manhattan chapter and take notes about sites that were interesting and put your notes into notion.\nWhat is notion? A bunch of things. It’s a cloud-based productivity app with many features. It’s really simple to use a text editor. Everything is based on making “pages” that you can put things into, just like any word-processor. It’s possible to put pages within pages, most types of media, and even inline databases. There are many integrations with other web apps. Notion pages can be shared on the internet with a single click. And, it is possible to create teamspaces, where multiple people can work together. Kind of like group editing a google doc, but with a different feature set.\nIt’s now week 4, and the class is moved onto notion. We will likely stay working there for the semester, and then archive our work publicly at the end.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBank Muñoz, Carolina, Penny Lewis, and Emily Tumpson Molina. 2022.

    "text": "This is a retrospective contribution. The blog part of this website was created on February 2nd. The class was held on Wednesday, January, 25th.\nMy goal for the first class was to meet everyone and give some overview of the goals for the course.\nThe room was too small and too hot. We we went around the room introduced ourselves. I asked everyone to share something about what they learned in the first Macaulay seminar, which was focused on Art in NYC.\nI introduced the concept of the final project and described a few different digital technologies we would learn about throughout the course. Some of the tech tools like notion, zotero, and quarto were since added to the compendium. A full description of the final project has not been produced yet, but will become available as the class narrows down on its goals through discussion.\nThe major assignment was to read the introduction of our textbook (Bank Muñoz, Lewis, and Molina 2022) and be prepared to discuss it for next class."

    "text": "Behind the scenes organizational stuff\nThis is my first time teaching Seminar 2. I usually teach cognition and statistics related courses. Another first is using notion.so to organize the course.\nThis course website and blog is being written using quarto, but notion is where most of the planning is happening.\nNotion has a lot to offer, and I’m barely scratching the surface. I have a single document for this course in notion, and this contains all sorts of other notion pages and collected notes. Inline databases are the most useful feature for course organization.\nThe inline database is great for creating a schedule because it has a calendar view making it easy to select individual dates for each class. It’s possible to export the database as markdown and csv, which made it easy to pop into the syllabus.\n\nThe most interesting part is the ability to add notion pages inside pages, and inside of database entries. For example, the entry for January 30th has a notion page, which is showing up on the right-hand side of the screen. This is a useful location to write class notes, announcements, brainstorm possible activities for next class, and generally link organizational material to specific classes. If I end up teaching this class again, I can come back and see what was happening on a class-by-class basis. I liked notion so much that I’m using it to organize all my other classes."

Readings will generally be assigned on Wednesday for discussion on Monday. This gives more days to complete the readings. Wednesday can be some discussion overflow, but mostly for in-class work-shopping.\nThe textbook is one general reading goal for the semester, and there are several others as well that will be provided on blackboard. The non-textbook readings are not yet announced because they are TBD through our class discussions. The advantage is the readings can be responsive to the dynamics of our discussion. The disadvantage is that no one can read ahead if they don’t know what we might read besides the textbook.\nI’m rapidly developing a solution in the form of a shared zotero library. This library will contain all the additional readings, as well as suggested readings, and class researched materials. The zotero library should be available mid-February or earlier."

The groups had 5 minutes to discuss a prompt. After discussion each group leader reported back a summary of the group discussion to the whole class. For the next discussion prompt, the group chose a new leader who would report back to the class. Some of our discussion prompts were:\n\nGet to know each other for 5 minutes (totally unstructured)\nWhat did you find interesting about the reading?\nWhat guidelines should we keep in mind for having productive, mindful and constructive conversations.\nLet’s talk about your reading process. What did you do as you read this chapter? What was your process?\nBased on the reading as a whole, what is/are the purpose(s) of this book?\n\nThe intro had four major sections, and the last discussion prompt was for each group to take one section and discuss it, and then report back. We ran out of time on this one, and took a paragraph-by-paragraph approach in the next class."

I came prepared to moderate this if necessary. I printed out a spreadsheet with everyone’s name and started to check off boxes whenever anyone spoke. My plan was to make sure everyone was contributing as much as possible. I found it difficult to listen and search for boxes to check at the same time, so I stopped tracking this.\nI remember seeing a discussion tracking activity somewhere that could be an alternative. It looked something like this:\nEach person gets a sheet of paper, and as the group has a discussion the members trace lines show who spoke. The paper keeps a record of turn taking. We might try this at some point to see how it lands."

    "title": "The Settlement House Movement",
    "section": "",
    "text": "After the Civil War, the emancipation of slaves, influx of immigrants, and industrialization spurred more activism in social work. Around the turn of the 1900s, northern cities experienced an influx of immigrants from Europe and a Great Migration of African Americans from the American South. Between the 1880s and 1920s, hundreds of settlement houses were established in American cities in response to European immigration and urban poverty brought about by industrialization and exploitative labor practices. Settlement houses provided support services like education, healthcare, childcare, employment resources, and even offered kindergarten classes before they were offered in many public school districts.\nMany middle-class charity workers thought that poverty was a moral failing. Charities often lumped people into categories of “worthy” or “unworthy” of help. The settlement movement changed popular conceptions about charity and social welfare. They approached the poor from a different perspective, and envisioned not charitable work, but social work.\nToynbee Hall opened in London in 1884, and was the prototype for the settlement house. Stanton Coit lived there for several months, and was inspired by it to open “Neighborhood Guild” in 1886, the first American settlement house on the Lower East Side of New York. In 1889, Jane Addams and Ellen Gates Starr launched Hull House in Chicago. The Hull House served as a model for over 400 other settlements across the country.\nAddams explained that those with public spirit could use their knowledge of tenants’ rights to help and cooperate with immigrants living in crowded unsanitary tenements who did not know how to reach the board of health. Addams believed in the interdependence of social classes and in the importance of working with and among working class communities. As settlement house residents learned more about their communities, they proposed changes in local government and lobbied for state and federal legislation on social and economic problems.\nLillian Wald was a nurse who taught lessons in a school in the Lower East Side, New York. When she learned of the unsanitary conditions in tenements and the poor health of their inhabitants, she became determined to move to the neighborhood, to live among the poor. With fellow nurse Mary Brewster, she rented an apartment as a place to provide health care to the community, and eventually moved the settlement to a house purchased for her by philanthropist Jacob Schiff. Founded in 1893, this became the Henry Street Settlement.\nJane Addams and Lillian Wald also campaigned against child labor and for public health, sanitation, industrial workplace safety reform, and women’s suffrage. Many settlement houses established during this period are still thriving today.\nDuring the Great Migration, many white-run settlements and other institutions, like the YWCA, refused to serve African Americans. Others served Black families when they lived nearby, but did not do outreach into Black neighborhoods. African American activists, including Ida B. Wells and Elizabeth Lindsay Davis, were the driving forces behind expanding African Americans’ access to social services. These reformers created separate or integrated facilities in African American neighborhoods to help Black migrants adjust from life in the rural South.\nCurrent or former settlement workers helped craft the Social Security Act of 1935 and other reform legislation of Franklin Roosevelt’s administration. The War on Poverty in the 1960s would revive many settlements that closed due to the Great Depression. In 1966 the settlement’s budget was about $100,000, mostly from private sources, but by 2002 its budget was $33,000,000, with 80 percent coming from government sources.\nToday, the settlement house remains one of the primary community-based social-service providers in NYC. Places called “neighborhood house,” “settlement house,” and “community center” are often part of the settlement-house tradition. Settlements today are different from those founded in the 1890s and 1900s—they no longer have workers living as residents, they receive more public than private funding, and they no longer see creating cross-class relationships as central to their mission—but they still reflect the initiative of the settlement-house founders to provide direct services to communities in need."

Extensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums and historical and cultural sites across the city.\nCourse Description: In this seminar, students use the tools of the social sciences, from oral history to mapping and participant observation and beyond, to investigate how the diverse people of New York City shape its identity, past, present, and future. Seminar topics include: the experiences of Indigenous and enslaved populations; the ongoing consequences of settler colonialism; the ways in which culture, class, religion, race, gender, ethnicity, xenophobia, and racism have shaped New Yorkers’ experiences with and within the city; the formation and social organization of New York’s communities; the impact of successive waves of newcomers to the city on urban culture and politics; and the continuing debates over assimilation, cultural retention, and “Americanization.”\nExtensive reading and writing assignments are enriched by visits to neighborhoods, museums, and historical and cultural sites across the city and the use of demographic, population and other quantitative data as well as qualitative approaches. All classes create public-facing final projects, documenting their research and presenting an aspect of New York City’s diversity.\n\nLearning Goals/Outcomes\nStudents will:\n\nDemonstrate a comparative understanding of different populations through research and writing about one or more groups or about an area of the city and its shifting population across time.\nUse a variety of approaches (e.g. qualitative, quantitative, or experiential) to studying people in order to come to an understanding of the diversity of people’s experiences in and of the city.\nUnderstand the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches and methodologies used by the social sciences.\nIncrease their understanding of past and present issues including colonialism, migration, immigration, race, and ethnicity by analyzing a variety of sources (current, historical, primary, secondary) and by engaging in active discussion about those issues.\nPresent their research to a public audience through a final project that may be completed by small groups or the entire class.\nCritically examine their own roles in and effect on the communities of New York City."

You can expect that the early weeks of this class will involve class discussions about “how” we will accomplish the goals of this class.\nSome of the general expectations for this class are set forth on the class website in the compendium:\nhttps://crumplab.com/peopleofnyc/compendium/Seminar_2_general_info.html\nOur class will attempt to weave through several different goals. One goal is to become familiar with research methods used in the social sciences to ask and answer complex issues about people and society. Individual segments of the course are structured around specific methods. Another goal is to use digital technology to facilitate and share our research findings and process. This course will introduce you to many research technologies that will help you throughout your undergraduate experience, and helpful notes about using these tools will be uploaded to the compendium across the semester. A last major goal is to create a public-facing expression of our work as a class. To this end, we are going to produce our own student-authored, web-based version of the course textbook, complete with suggested walking tours. More on that throughout the semester."

All readings other than the textbook will be provided on blackboard. Our class meets two times per week on Mondays and Wednesdays.\nWeekly assignments may vary, but will generally take the form of blog posts. Students will be shown how to set-up a personal blog, and will contribute notes to the blog as a way to engage with course content. Students are strongly encouraged to be as creative as possible when “Blogging” this course, and class time will be spent on learning how to maximise the usefulness of blogging to substantially enhance engagement with content.\n\nFinal Project\nThe final project will involve writing our very own “People’s Guide to NYC”, and then sharing it online as website and online book. The model for the final project is our textbook. The textbook is organized as a series of short vignettes about people and places in NYC.

The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\nMissing an Exam\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nEmail Correspondence\nI will regularly use e-mail via blackboard to send out announcements, changes in the syllabus, reminders about tests or due dates etc. It is your responsibility to check e-mail regularly to keep up-to-date with these announcements.

The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

Teaching all of these tools are way beyond the scope of this class.\nHowever, quarto makes many things easy, and it is possible to use the platform without much prior experience with coding.

I am sharing some of this info here to provide more context for the course.\n‘The course was originally titled “The Peopling of New York City,” and focused on patterns of immigration as well as neighborhood constitution and dynamics. In conversations with faculty, students and ITFs/TLCs, we’ve moved towards a slight modification to that title. “The People of New York City” more accurately reflects the content the course should cover. Immigration is not an unqualified positive story, and the story of the people of New York includes indigenous populations (past and present), as well as those whose ancestors (near or far) were brought to New York without choosing to come voluntarily. Questions of gentrification, race, culture, gender, homelessness, inequality, education, cultural appropriation (and more) can all be part of the content of this course, and the narratives that the course pursues are complex and multifaceted.’\n“This is an interdisciplinary course, and should be taught as such. It is not a history course, a sociology course, or an anthropology course, but it often has elements of all of those fields. It should not be seen as an introductory course to any specific field, but instead a cross-disciplinary examination of the ways that different areas in the social sciences might approach the same content area. The course should provide some comparison of different approaches in every individual section. Sociology, anthropology, history, political science, geography, demographics (and more) are all welcome, but no single one of these areas should be the sole focus of the course.”"

    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2019, Govenor Andrew Cuomo began to crack down on New York City subway crime. In an effort to improve quality of life, he focused the New York Police Department on fare evasion and subway vendors. Since then, New York City subways have become flooded with NYPD. Despite this, the organization is in debt, and politicians have been looking for ways to earn more money. Cracking down on subway vendors looked like the answer. Mayor Eric Adams continued the initiative when he was inaugerated on January 1st, 2022.\nIn May 2022, a video of a subway vendor, María Falcon, getting handcuffed and arrested next to her cart of mangos went viral on Twitter. Outrage sparked from New Yorkers and non-New Yorkers alike. Falcon was an immigrant woman from Ecuador trying to make a living. Mayor Adams confronted this outrage by saying that, if subway vendors were allowed to continue, then greater risks will follow, such as propane tanks and barbeques in subway stations. This is rooted in the broken windows theory, which promotes cracking down on small crimes to prevent larger crimes. The broken windows theory is notorious for being ineffective, yet many police departments, including the NYPD, follow it.\nThe villification of subway vendors does nothing to stop crime. Falcon was arrested at Broadway Junction, a station in Brooklyn with five trains. It was notoriously dangerous, with violence and drugs being the norm. The NYPD rarely stops these crimes, but that did not stop them from arresting Falcon. If Mayor Adams really cared about subway crime, then why are people afraid of knives and subway pushers at Broadway Junction?\nFood vendors like Falcon are not the only victims of this treatment. John Ajilo was a saxophonist at Herald Square station in Manhattan known for the tiny robot kittens he performs with. He is a beloved character that has been at Herald Square for decades. In June 2022, he was arrested and detained for hours overnight. Just like with Falcon, outraged sparked. A GoFundMe was launched and raised over $110,000 for Ajilo’s legal fees.\nMayor Adams defends this policing by saying that subway vendors and performers obstruct traffic flow. Specifically about vendors, he says that they need a liscense of sell food. However, it is immensely difficult to obtain a vending license because it is capped at 5,000 in New York City and there are 2,500 people on the waitlist.\nThe Street Vendor Project is a nonprofit that defends street vendors like the ones being harrassed in New York City subway stations. They say that subway vendors are part of New York City culture. Also, they say that subway vendors support the economy by responding to consumer demand. The Street Vendor Project’s work includes helping subway vendors get liscenses so they do not have to fear the NYPD as much.\nArresting subway vendors and street performers is not the answer to subway crime. The NYPD is already overpowered, and this initiative will only harm more immigrant communities and communities of color."

    "title": "Sheepshead Bay",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Untitled\nThe Canarsee Indians lived largely undisturbed until almost 150 years after European settlers arrived in nearby Gravesend in 1643. In the 18th century, the Wyckoff and Lott families established homesteads and built farms in the area. The Henry and Abraham Wyckoff House, built in 1766, still stands today on the corner of Kings Highway and East 22nd Street. One Wyckoff family home is the Pieter Claesen House, built in 1652 in what is now Flatlands, Brooklyn and believed to be the oldest surviving home in the City. Restored in 1982, the Pieter Claesen House is now a public museum. The Hendrick I. Lott House, built in 1720 and enlarged in 1800, is another landmark home in Flatlands, standing on East 36th Street.\nFishing in the bay became popular in the early 1800s, and little cottages soon dotted the rim of the inlet. Sheepshead Bay, named after the type of fish, has been a spot for fishing, sailing, and other maritime activities since pre-colonial times. It was originally part of the Coney Island Creek. In the 1840s and before, Sheepshead Bay was a secluded fishing and farming community. It became an early vacation destination in the summers starting in 1840. Benjamin Freeman, who owned much of the land around the bay, became one of the first entrepreneurs to open a hotel here in 1844. He called it The Sheepshead, named after the type of common variety marine fish. This would give the area its unusual name. Tourists came in the mid-19th century, when Sam Leonard’s Hotel and Tappen’s Hotel were built. The opening of Ocean Avenue provided the first direct route to the area.\nDuring the mid and late 19th century, the bay area did not have the same luxurious reputation as Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach. In the 1870s, a large farm was subdivided for development and began a trend that led to the construction of more than 400 houses by the end of the century, along with shops, churches, and a post office. Seafood restaurants and other businesses began to pop up along Emmons Avenue. The Ocean Avenue Footbridge dates back to 1880 when it was built by Austin Corbin. The bridge allows people to cross the bay, and connects Sheepshead Bay from Emmons Avenue and East 19th street to Manhattan Beach.\nSports defined the early recreations of Sheepshead Bay, and it was not just fishing and boating. In 1880, the Coney Island Jockey Club created a racetrack, which led to a population growth in the surrounding areas of the Bay. This was a popular draw due to the Gilded Age moguls who funded the venture, including the godfather of horse racing August Belmont Jr.\nThe Sheepshead Bay racetrack, taken by George Bradford Brainard, courtesy the Brooklyn Museum\nIn around 1900, Capital James W. Corrigall created a ferry service that transported people from Sheepshead Bay to Plum Beach, a neighborhood where many locals had summer bungalows. In 1911, the Sheepshead Bay Race Track also served as a runway for the Vin Fiz, piloted by Calbraith P. Rodgers, when it made the world’s first transcontinental flight. When racetrack betting became illegal in the 1910s, the track was refitted for auto racing. One Sheepshead Bay “race” had been between an automobile driven by Italian racing legend Dario Resta and an airplane steered by pioneering pilot Katherine Stinson.\nFrom the Library of Congress\nThe Sheepshead Speedway replaced the track when the Jockey Club disbanded in 1915. The decline of the racetrack after horse betting was criminalized saw the track host auto racing for a few years form 1915-1919, but this too fell out of popular tourism attractions. Coney Island opened not too far away and had a subway connection, also leading to the decline of Sheepshead Bay as a tourist destination. Vacant lots opened, the race track was subdivided for housing and Millionaire’s Row featured bungalows, leading to an influx of permanent residents. The famous automobile track was demolished in 1919, and replaced with housing.\nThe channel of Sheepshead Bay waterway was officially dredged by 1916 and in 1922 the New York City Dock Commission dredged the Bay further to expand Emmons Avenue. The City revitalized the neighborhood in the 1930s, with improvements such as the widening of Emmons Avenue and the modernization of buildings by the bay. As Sheepshead Bay became more residential, and people wanted a place to store their boats and spend time with other locals, yacht clubs began to form. The Miramar Yacht Club was founded in 1932 at 3128 Emmons Avenue as the Miramar Boat and Canoe Club. Sheepshead Bay was also home to a maritime training station during the Second World War. The station opened on September 1, 1942 and spanned 76 acres across the Bay, and according to records, around 115,000 servicemen were trained there. The site is now home to Kingsborough Community College. In the 1950s, brick apartment buildings replaced the wooden houses, and by 1960, Sheepshead Bay was the fastest growing community in Brooklyn.\nOver the years, Sheepshead bay transitioned from predominantly Irish and Italian to a more diverse neighborhood. The population increased during the 20th century. Jewish and Soviet immigrants moved to the area in the mid-late 20th century. Avenue U Chinatown is partially in Sheepshead Bay. Albanians, Turks and Hispanics also have high populations in the neighborhood. Development of the neighborhood continued. Today, Sheepshead Bay is mostly residential. High density condos are more common near the center of the neighborhood near Ocean Avenue. The northern shoreline along the bay features piers, an active seafood market, and tour boats. This area also has many restaurants and four branches of the Brooklyn Public Library spread throughout. The New York City Subway has service to the area by the BMT Brighton Line (Trains B and Q).\nZohra Saed is a poet, editor and translator who was born in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, and immigrated to Brooklyn with her family as a child in the 1980s. It was comfortable to settle in Sheepshead Bay due to there being many other Turkic people there. She grew up in the close-knit Uzbek-Turkestani community on Ocean Avenue in Sheepshead Bay and roamed Neptune Avenue in Brighton Beach. In an interview for the Coney Island History Project, Zohra reads two of her poems, “Brooklyn” and “Neptune Avenue,” which evoke scenes of her childhood. She writes about the place she and her friends used to play between Brighton Beach and Sheepshead Bay, and her times at the boardwalk along Coney Island. Zohra remembers playing in between the Brighton Beach bungalows, where some of her friends lived. She tells of ghost stories from Lundy’s and how she would dream of horses when she lived in a building where there were once horse races nearby. Sheepshead Bay had many diverse and multicultural spaces such as Russian, Turkish, and later Chinese American. Access to Southern Brooklyn involved access to beaches and getting invited over to other families’ homes. Zohra spoke Farsi, Uzbek, and Arabic before learning English at PS 254, a diverse school where she bonded with teachers and students. She went to Cunningham in Homecrest for junior high school, Sheepshead Bay High School, and Brooklyn College. She has an MFA in poetry from Brooklyn College and a PhD in Literature from the CUNY Grad Center. She also translates poetry from Turkestani and is a Distinguished Lecturer at Macaulay Honors College."

    "section": "",
    "text": "In the late 1920s, art patrons Lillie P. Bliss, Mary Quinn Sullivan, and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller sought to establish an institution devoted exclusively to modern art. The Museum’s mission began with the vision of its three founders who met on a trip to Egypt in 1928. ****Bliss was the daughter of a textile manufacturer as well as a collector of modern paintings and prints. Sullivan worked as an art teacher in New York, and although was not a collector of art herself, her husband, Cornelius J. Sullivan, was. ****Rockefeller, on the other hand, cared deeply for classic and modern art, and shared a “concern for the arts of her own time.” ****The three banded together to not only continue collecting modern art, but aimed to put it on public display in their newly founded museum. The Museum struggled in a time when “few attempted to collect modern art seriously.” ****The founders were aware that constructing the MoMA would be a risky venture, but their growing board of trustees, A. Conger Goodyear, Paul Sachs, Frank Crowninshield, and Josephine Boardman Crane, as well as the appointment of Alfred H. Barr Jr. as their director in 1929, proved successful.\nFrom left: Lillie P. Bliss, c. 1924; Mary Quinn Sullivan; Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr.), 1922 https://www.moma.org/interactives/moma_through_time/1920/three-women-have-a-vision/\nWhen the MoMA first opened on November 7, 1929, the museum was not the institution today’s visitors might expect. At the time, the Metropolitan Museum of Art had the spotlight and did not share it, and it did not feature modern art. When the opening of the MoMA was first announced by the seven collectors and patrons that founded it, the museum was just a few rooms in the Heckscher building, on the corner of 5th Avenue and 57th Street. The MoMA was officially established “in rented quarters on the twelfth floor of an office building at 730 Fifth Avenue…” and held its first exhibition seven days after opening. ****Yet this did not make a difference. The public’s response was overwhelmingly enthusiastic. On November 8th, 1929, paintings and prints from the combined collections of the founders were featured in the exhibition Cézanne, Gauguin, Seurat, van Gogh, which attracted about 49,000 visitors to the tight gallery rooms of the museum. ****The following March, 1,500 people a day visited the museum and the trustees had to start charging admission, which would be 50 cents per person, to better manage the flow of visitors. The MoMA lacked a permanent collection until 1931, as all exhibits featured either pieces from the founders’ collections or from temporary donations from trustees. ****The founders, starting with Bliss, donated works to the permanent collection and allowed for their paintings to be sold to further fund the MoMA. In the next 10 years, the Museum moved three times into larger temporary quarters. In 1932, the museum moved to a site on 53rd Street, and in 1939 opened the building in midtown Manhattan. Over the years, it would evolve into the building MoMA inhabits today, with six floors of galleries instead of six rooms.\nA view of the exhibition “Bauhaus: 1919-1928,” which was on view from Dec. 7, 1938, through Jan. 30, 1939. Soichi Sunami, The Museum of Modern Art Archives, New York\nThe Museum of Modern Art is a comprehensive collection of primarily American and European art ranging from the late 19th century to the present. Its founders dedicated the museum to the most progressive tendencies in modern art. It has an extensive collection of Cubist, Surrealist, and Abstract Expressionist paintings. The museum was one of the first in the United States to include in its collection industrial design, architecture, photography, and motion pictures. The original director Alfred H. Barr Jr. submitted a plan for a multi-departmental structure. Today, these departments include architecture and design, drawings and prints, film, media and performance, painting and sculpture, and photography. The 1939 museum building by Philip Goodwin and Edward Durell Stone was later expanded with an addition designed by Philip Johnson, who also planned the garden in 1953. Expansions took place during the 1950s and 1960s. A major renovation, including a condominium tower and a west wing, doubled the museum’s exhibition space, and was completed in 1984. Continued expansion through enlarging the exhibit space, adding skylights, relocating the main entrance, and building an education and research complex, was designed by Yoshio Taniguchi and completed in 2004. A large expansion also occurred in 2019, with a complete rehang of the collection. The exhibition had formerly been based on chronology, discipline, or region, but this time curators displayed works based on theme and also addressed diversity by integrating more art by women and people of color.\nFrom an initial gift of eight prints and one drawing, The MoMA’s collection has grown to approximately 200,000 works. MoMA also owns approximately two million film stills. The Museum’s Library and Archives contain the leading concentration of research material on modern art in the world, and each of the curatorial departments maintains a study center available to students, scholars, and researchers. MoMA’s Library holds over 320,000 items, including books, artists’ books, periodicals, and extensive individual files on more than 90,000 artists. In addition to gallery talks, lectures, and symposia, the Museum offers special activities for parents, teachers, families, students, preschoolers, bilingual visitors, and people with special needs. In January 2000, the Museum and P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) exercised a Memorandum of Understanding formalizing their affiliation.\nP.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1). (c. 2000). Photo: John Harris\nFounded by curator Alanna Heiss, MoMA PS1 (originally known as P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center) was a defining force in the alternative space movement in New York in the 1970s. PS1—a historic 19th century public school building in Long Island City, Queens—has been transformed into a place for artistic experimentation and creativity. Located in what was once a thriving industrial enclave, PS1 has now become a cultural landmark in one of the fastest-growing, urban residential neighborhoods in the country. Decommissioned as a public school in 1963, the building was first secured from the city by the Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc., a non-profit founded by Heiss in 1972 to provide studios and exhibition space in underutilized buildings across New York City. In 1976, PS1 opened with the seminal Rooms exhibition, which was an invitation for artists to transform the building’s spaces with site-specific installations. Over 70 artists activated the campus, which is a tradition that continues to this day with 15 artist interventions across the building. Artists featured in the showrooms were mostly New York artists. Beginning in 1980, PS1 housed the Department of Cultural Affairs’ Materials Donation Program—now known as Materials for the Arts. Since 1982, PS1 has been a member of the City’s Cultural Institutions Group (CIG) in partnership with the Department of Cultural Affairs—the first member focused on contemporary art. To celebrate its affiliation with the Museum of Modern Art in 2000, Greater New York was launched and has taken place every five years since. PS1’s performances, residencies, and events have grown to include more than 3,000 multidisciplinary artists, musicians, scholars, activists, and thinkers to date. In 1997, a campus-wide renovation included the creation of a large outdoor courtyard. Warm Up summer music series (established in 1998) and the Young Architects Program (1999–2019) were launched. Today, The Museum of Modern Art and MoMA PS1 welcome millions of visitors every year.\nThe MoMA was the first museum “in America to integrate twentieth-century fine and applied art” and “has built an unrivaled multi departmental collection while at the same time conducting a coherent and adventurous program of exhibitions and related educational activities.” The MoMA, according to its director in 2004, Glenn D. Lowry, is “predicated on a relatively simple proposition, that the art of our time – modern art – is as vital and important as the art of the past.” ****As of 2004, “The Museum owns over 6,000 drawings, 50,000 prints and illustrated books, 25,000 photographs, 3,200 paintings and sculptures, 24,000 works of architecture and design, and 20,000 films, videos, and other media works.”\nThe Museum of Modern Art in New York.

    "text": "Who are Women in Need? Well, this organization started in 1983 when a group of women that decided to call themselves “Women in Need”open a shelter for four woman and their kids, with the help of the Church of St. Mary.After realizing the needs that many women had around that time Win decided to open another shelter, but this time in Brooklyn called”Monica House”, three years after they open another homeless house in the Bronx called Casa Rita for 16 families. In 1987 Win opened Alexander Abraham Residence for 31 families also in Manhattan and two other home shelter in the Bronx in 1989. Win is the largest shelter giver. You might be asking yourself, what do they do? Or how many people they have helped? Something interesting about this organization is that Win has fourth teen shelters around the borough that provide house to more than 1000 women in need and their Childs every day. This website illustrates, “4,800 people are houses by WIN, each night including over 2700 children”. This shows this shows that the organization contains a wide range of homeless people helpers that offer a better life to all these women and their families. Among the services provided are case management, support, and long-term residential housing. Case managers who deal with clients make house calls and have regular office hours. Case management services can also include crisis intervention, job training and workforce readiness counseling, education counseling, assistance with budgeting and other financial literacy skills, and referrals to programs for physical and/or mental health difficulties, depending on the client.\nAdditionally, Win is also recognized because they offer traditional and temporary houses for the homeless women they attend.“ClearPath”demonstrates that, “nearly 10% of homeless families in New York City are housed by WIN.” This only shows that Win gives homeless families in New York City the comprehensive support they need to thrive on their own, including safe homes, vital resources, and ground-breaking initiatives. As a result, these families reclaim their independence, and their children may look forward to a better future. NYC DHS expresses that, The Housing Assistance Program, an anti-eviction initiative aimed at a high-risk zip code in the Bronx, was developed and implemented with Win’s help as a significant partner in recent years. This involvement with DHS’s homelessness prevention initiatives has increased. This demonstrates that they not only work alone to improve the community, but also collaborate with other organizations to make their impact better. To end the cycle of homelessness and shorten the time that people spend living in shelters, Win is advocating for changes that will assist New York families in finding and maintaining permanent homes. The thousands of families and kids who are experiencing homelessness will have more housing stability thanks to these actions, which will significantly reduce instability and enhance outcomes. By updating the city’s Family Intake procedure and establishing a shelter development fund for reputable charity providers, you can make sure that families in need may get the resources they need for refuge. Increase the quantity of rental aid vouchers available to families and enforce the fair housing legislation. Provide families the resources they need to keep a permanent home, such as childcare subsidies, 18 months of aftercare, and routes to respectable work."

    "text": "On October 26, 2021, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a 425 million dollar project with the Community Parks Initiative (CPI). Within the next ten years CPI guarantees to rebuild up to 10 community parks a year.\nThe Community Parks initiative began in 2014. CPI began by reviewing data on New York City’s park investments from the last 20 years. The data showed that less advantaged communities had underinvested parks. These parks were empty, ruined, and outdated. In response CPI promises to renew these parks, but also connect its community to make sure a healthy environment emerges. CPI encourages communities to contribute by engaging them in the planning process by organizing social gathering events and activities. CPI also has a webpage if members of the community prefer to contribute remotely.\nVan Alst playground located in the borough of Queens was CPI’s first successful project. CPI renovated the children’s playground by giving it a more fun and attractive look, and from that day on, CPI has renewed over 110 community parks across all five boroughs. The initiative focuses on repainting basketball courts, nets, handball courts, fences, remodeling playgrounds, swings, workout equipment, and gardens. Not to mention, CPI also provides service for the health and planning processes of communities.\nThe Community Parks initiative is a very beneficial pathway for New York City because the people practice interconnectedness and safety. Community parks are rarely empty because they are much more approachable and clean. The parks are attractive to people of all ages. It’s a place where people can go out and be active. A place where anyone can meet someone new and get along. The sense of danger is eliminated and parents feel safe having their kids around. As members of the community continue to provide maintenance and service to the park, the safety and interconnectedness status remains active. Applying such a change to underserved communities delivers a message that members of these communities are not forgotten."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Small businesses are a major component of a healthy and growing economy. Small businesses provide more jobs, careers, and opportunities for people. Their payrolls and taxes are the way that small businesses give back to the community. For the average American, the issue that arises is how to actually start a small business. The amount of beginning capital that is required is astronomical and these people need counseling in how to start, manage, and grow their small business. In addition, the average survival rate for a new firm is two years, and 44% of small businesses fail within two years. Furthermore, 81% fail within ten years. So the question begs, how are people that seek to open a small business supposed to get the help they need to succeed? To provide context to the answer, we will examine a story of a small business owner and how he managed to start and expand his business.\nJesse Camacho grew up in Puerto Rico and settled in the South Bronx. After he got laid off from his sales job, he set up his own shop and continued selling cleaning products by himself. However, he didn’t know where to start in securing contracts with federal agencies and to expand his network. This is when he came across the Small Business Administration. They helped him with the 8(a) Business Development program, and coached him in many areas of business. Now, he has secured many contracts with federal agencies and has ten employees working for him in a thriving business.\nThis is how the Small Business Administration can help small businesses. Created in 1953 by Dwight D. Eisenhower as an independent agency of the federal government, this organization aims to help people plan, launch, manage, and grow their small businesses. They provide counseling services free of charge, business loans, home and disaster loans, and help to win government contracts for small businesses.\nHowever, there are many major issues regarding the Small Business Administration. For one, small businesses are still failing at astronomical rates. That begs the question: is the Small Business Administration really helping small businesses at all? If so many small businesses are failing within a just a couple years of starting out, then maybe the Small Business Administration is not solving the real issues at hand and is just profiting off the interest on the loans and giving these small business owners false hope in that they can cultivate thriving businesses. The other major issue is that in the early days of the pandemic, the Small Business Administration gave out $4.5 billion in grants based on the number of employees working in the business. People lied about the amount of employees they had and claimed so much money from the program. This shows us that the administration really had no idea what they were doing when they were practically handing out money to anyone that accepted it. These are some of the major issues that plague the Small Business Administration to this day, and we hope they can get a handle on it and solve the real issues at play here."

    "title": "Housing Shortages",
    "section": "",
    "text": "AIA New York Conference to Tackle New York City’s Housing Crisis\nHousing shortage has become a problem in New York City over the past couple of decades. Every borough has been affected by this problem. This has occurred because the population of New York City is increasing every single year. The population has exceeded the expectations of the past. Housing shortage has affected many people because the rent is going up and low-income families can’t afford those rental households.\n\nThe Global Housing Crisis: A Crisis Unlike Any Other - Urbanet\nThere are many statistics that convey how horrible the housing shortage is for low income families. Statistics from National Low Income Housing Coalition(NLIHC) show that only 28% of rental households are extremely low-income. That goes to show that low income families are struggling to survive because the supply is lower than the demand. In addition, 73% of extremely low income renters are struggling because of the severe cost burden. This goes to show that most of low income families can’t really live because they are living paycheck to paycheck. With the population growing at a fast rate it will only be harder for those families.\n\nMore than 500,000 apartments are needed to accommodate the population growth by 2030. Spectrum News suggests that the average rent in Manhattan since August 2022 is $5,246. These details show that the population is growing rapidly and the price of rental apartments are increasing. Also, the vacancy rate for low-income apartments are 0.9%. That means that many low-income rental apartments are pretty much filled. These details show that housing shortages are an increasing problem.\nAccording to Multifamily Loans, New York is the number one metro area with the most housing shortages. It is stated that three quarters of New York’s apartments are more than four decades old. That’s around 1.7 million old units. This implies that renovations are also apart of the problem. Also the housing would have maintenance for multiple years so the cost only piling up even more. Unless people are moved out, that will probably leave people homeless and the rent will probably go up because of the renovation/rebuild.\nThe housing shortages also tie in with homelessness because people are getting evicted, therefore leaving them homeless. More than 70,000 people are sleeping in shelters and that number is going to add up with the housing shortage. Eviction court filings doubled since 2021. This conveys that the housing shortages are leaving people in shelters or on the street. The rent is increasing and people don’t have the money to keep up with it.\nNew York has the lowest homeownership rate out of the all country in 2021. New York is at the bottom with 55.4% of homeownership. Also in New York the city has the lowest precent of homeownership compared to the rest of the state. Each borough have under 45% of homeownership while the rest of the state have 54% or up. This shows that many people in the city of New York don’t own much property.\nAll in all, the housing shortages are a problem that need to be dealt with. There are a couple of ways that this problem can be improved. One way is to increase the housing units made for low-income families. Most of New York are low-income, and not tending to their needs show the lack of care from the state. Another solution is to create programs that help the unfortunate into housing. Also housing should be made on vacant properties or underused public spaces or private spaces.\n\n\nNational Low Income Housing Coalition. “New York.” Accessed March 27, 2023.https://nlihc.org/housing-needs-by-state/new-york.\nMultifamily Loans. “Top 10 Metros With the Largest Housing Shortages.” Accessed March 26, 2023.https://www.multifamily.loans/apartment-finance-blog/top-10-metros-with-the-largest-housing-shortages/.\n“In New York City, Housing Supply Continues to Fail to Meet Demand.” Accessed March 26, 2023.https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/housing/2022/10/07/new-york-city-housing-supply-demand.\nOffice of the New York State Comptroller. “Homeownership Rates in New York.” Accessed March 26, 2023.https://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/homeownership-rates-new-york.\nABC7 New York. “Eviction ‘floodgate’ Has Opened in NYC Due to Rising Rents, End of Pandemic Era Rental Aid,” February 15, 2023.https://abc7ny.com/housing-crisis-evictions-affordable-rent/12820437/."

    "title": "Friends of MTA: Brooklyn subway stations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Common complaints of subway stations in NYC include broken elevators, slippery stairs, and a lack of trash cans. These issues often go unnoticed by the MTA (Metropolitan Transit Authority). Recently, a new program in Brooklyn has surfaced, focusing on improving communication and accountability with regard to MTA train stations. Council Member Lincoln Restler announced this program in early March 2023. Under the name “Friends of MTA Station Initiative,” Restler is searching for commuters to volunteer to meet in groups with MTA officials. This is meant to encourage discussion between the MTA and riders.\nJon Orcutt, a transit advocate and transportation policy expert, believes this initiative will promote accountability. This initiative will start with five participating stations in northern Brooklyn: Jay Street, Nassau Avenue, Borough Hall, Bedford Avenue, and High Street. Friends of MTA is similar to “Friends of” groups for parks, as well as other public spaces and institutions. Prospect Park Alliance was founded in 1987 after years of deterioration in the park. A project they took on recently had to do with safety on Prospect Park Drive. Prospect Park Drive closed to outside vehicular traffic in 2018, and has never fully been redesigned since. Prospect Park Alliance released a study to provide information on the injuries and incidents that have occurred on Prospect Park Drive since its closure, in an attempt to call attention to the need of a redesign.\nFriends of MTA does not seek any donations, as it is mainly fueled by volunteers. Lincoln Restler aims at creating a ‘framework’ for accountability and station improvements that could make a “tangible difference” in the experiences of commuters. Newsbreak contributor Sara Irshad said that the initiative is “an excellent opportunity for New Yorkers to take an active role in improving the subway system.” The focus of Friends of MTA is on commuter involvement and communication with officials.\nMTA improvement advocacy existed long before the introduction of this initiative. Riders Alliance formed in 2012, and has become a prominent organization aiming at identifying issues in the wider MTA system, including busses. Riders Alliance is more of an advocating movement, while Friends of MTA is directly involved with officials. Another key difference is that Friends of MTA is focused on five subway stations instead of the entire system. A press release states, “Groups will meet with MTA and other agency officials to discuss station conditions, conduct walkthroughs, and learn more about what is currently done under MTA’s operating and capital budgets. The purpose of this engagement model is to provide the community with a better understanding of their stations and have a consistent line of communication with the MTA.” Communication is key in the functionality of this initiative. Although there hasn’t been word on it yet, the Friends of MTA program may extend to more stations in the future, or inspire similar programs."

    "title": "De Blasio’s Rat Elimination Initiative",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In 2017, the de Blasio administration announced a $32 million neighborhood rat reduction plan. The plan aimed to reduce rat populations in Lower Manhattan, Bushwick in Brooklyn, and the Grand Concourse area in the Bronx by implementing various strategies such as increased garbage pickup, rat-proof garbage cans, and dry ice extermination. The less obvious, more innovative, and more ethically ambiguous methods such as expanding the use of dry ice extermination and rat birth control stand out. These efforts have been accompanied by community outreach and education programs to help residents better understand how to prevent rat infestations in their neighborhoods.\nIn each of the government reports, the city has emphasized the ways in which rats lead to the spread of disease. One recent study, from the American Society of Microbiology, reported that rats in NYC have tested positive for antibodies for SARS-CoV-2. The delta variant was particularly infectious among rats. There needs to be more research to find out whether rats can give the virus back to humans. However, this among many other data points, highlight the dangers of large rat infestations.\nDespite some skepticism from residents and experts who questioned its effectiveness and the sustainability of its methods, the administration defended the plan, stating that it was a comprehensive effort to address the city’s rat problem. The City reported a 10% reduction in the number of rat sightings in the target neighborhoods.\nFurthermore, a study by Michael G. Walsh in PeerJ found that rat sightings in New York City were associated with neighborhood sociodemographics, housing characteristics, and proximity to open public space. The study concluded that a combination of structural improvements, such as better waste management and building maintenance, and community education and engagement were necessary to effectively control rat populations in the city. Based on these findings, the City has also focused on addressing the root causes of rat infestations, such as poor waste management and inadequate building maintenance, in addition to implementing targeted interventions.\nBefore this improvement initiative, the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice, reported that tracking infrastructure, such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), can be used to map and monitor rat sightings and infestations in real-time. This information can be used to identify high-risk areas and develop targeted interventions to prevent and control rat infestations. However, there is no indication on whether method was implemented in the decisions made during de Blasio’s initiative.\nSince de Blasio’s initiative, Mayor Adams has picked up where de Blasio left off in an attempt to further reduce rat populations in NYC. In fact, on April 1st, 2023, a smaller trash time window will be enforced such that trash spends less time on NYC streets where rats can feast.\nOverall, for most New Yorkers, it is probably surprising how much technology, money and resources have been spent on rat reduction. When taken at face value, the issue seems obvious, but not necessarily something to pour millions of dollars into.\n\nSources\n“De Blasio Administration Announces $32 Million Neighborhood Rat Reduction Plan.” The Official Website of the City of New York, 12 July 2017, http://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/472-17/de-blasio-administration-32-million-neighborhood-rat-reduction-plan.\nGoodman, J.

It has become one of the most iconic locations in the world of basketball, known for its rich history and its ability to attract the best streetball players in the world. The court has hosted some of the most famous basketball games in history, attracting basketball legends and famous spectators alike. The story of Rucker Park is the story of basketball in America and streetball.\nThe court was originally known as P.S. 156 Playground, but it was renamed in honor of Holcombe Rucker, a local basketball coach who organized tournaments and leagues for young players in the Harlem community. Rucker started the tournaments in the 1950s as a way to keep young people off the streets and engaged in healthy activities. Rucker’s dedication to helping the community made him an admired figure in the basketball culture. The tournaments were wildly popular, and they attracted some of the best streetball players in New York City.\nOver time, the tournaments at Rucker Park became more organized, and the competition became fiercer. The games were known for their high-flying dunks, flashy passes, and intense rivalries. Some of the best players in the world honed their skills at Rucker Park, including Julius Erving, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James, and Kevin Durant. Rucker Park has an intense atmosphere during tournaments.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Rucker Park became a cultural phenomenon. The park was featured in music videos, movies, and TV shows, and it became a symbol of the vibrant and diverse culture of Harlem. The games at Rucker Park became events in their own right, attracting thousands of spectators and inspiring imitators across the country.\nToday, Rucker Park is still a vital part of the basketball world. The park hosts summer tournaments every year, attracting some of the best streetball players in the world. The games are fiercely competitive, and they continue to showcase the best and brightest talents in the sport. Rucker Park is also home to the EBC Rucker Park All-Star Game, which is one of the most prestigious streetball events in the world. The “Entertainer’s Basketball Classic,” which takes place every summer and attracts some of the best streetball players from around the world. The tournament is known for its high-flying dunks, flashy ballhandling, and intense competition, and it has become a must-see event for basketball fans.\nThe history of Rucker Park is a testament to the power of basketball to bring people together and create community. The park has been a cultural touchstone for generations of New Yorkers, and it has helped to shape the game of basketball into the global phenomenon it is today. The legacy of Holcombe Rucker and the players who have graced the courts of Rucker Park lives on, inspiring new generations of basketball players and fans.\nSOURCES\n“Holcombe Rucker Park: NYC Parks.” Accessed May 1, 2023.https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/holcombe-rucker-park.\n“Rucker Park, a Basketball Mecca, Gets New Life - The New York Times.” Accessed May 1, 2023.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/10/sports/basketball/rucker-park-renovation.html.\n“Rucker Park - The Mecca of Basketball.” Accessed May 1, 2023.https://row.oneblockdown.it/blogs/archive/rucker-park-polo-grounds-harlem-new-york-basketball-hip-hop-history."

    "title": "Homelessness in NYC",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Homelessness in New York City is a crisis. We are facing an unprecedented homeless population that beats the rate from the Great Depression. Tens of thousands of adults and children sleep in the city’s shelters every night, and this rate is significantly higher than it was ten years ago. Not much is being done by the city government to combat this, and what is being done is insufficient or not solving the problem. The lack of affordable housing drives homelessness, followed by eviction, overcrowded housing, domestic violence, job loss, and hazardous housing conditions. Homeless people come from every community district in New York City, proving that this is a widespread problem, and suffer from higher rates of mental illness and addiction disorders. All of this is true, but city surveys significantly under-represent homeless statistics.\nThe current mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, has implemented a new policy in his first years as mayor to combat homelessness. He has been conducting sweeps on city streets and subway stations and cars, taking the homeless people there to shelters. Despite his best efforts, only thirty percent of homeless people being swept are still in those shelters after a week, and the rest are released. That remaining seventy percent return to the streets, undoing any progress Mayor Adams has caused. Homeless advocates, mental health advocates, and police officers all disagree with his policy. Homeless advocates say that the policing and forced removal is not the correct approach, and, instead, there needs to be a health and housing lens when looking at the problem. Mental health advocates say that Mayor Adams’ policy is a human rights violation, and the city has the power to provide onsite mental health treatment in shelters and supported housing. Police officers say that the sweeping and extra policing of homeless people places liability on them in dangerous situations, and could be fuel for escalation.\nProviding accessible and supportive housing is the best way to prevent and solve homelessness. In every trial, it has reduced the need for the solutions Mayor Adams is proposing: shelters, hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, and incarceration. It raises stability for tenants and reduces chronic homelessness for single adults. Economically, it has also been a boost. Real estate values rise in areas closest to supportive housing. Outside of statistics, supportive housing is just humane. Mayor Adams’ solution of sweeping homeless people into shelters (which are dangerous and uncomfortable for anyone) ignores their basic human autonomy.\nTo end homelessness, there needs to be a streamlined connection between the city and state governments. Oftentimes, they are at odds with each other, which only furthers the homelessness crisis and the mistreatment of homeless people. With a united approach on homelessness, featuring supportive housing and treatment, then the New York City homelessness rate could finally lower."

    "title": "New York’s Initiative on the Disabled Community",
    "section": "",
    "text": "There’s close to a million people that have some disability in New York City (NYC Mayor’s office). Disability is defined as a person who has any physical or mental limitations that prevents them from doing daily activities. In the past, disability was unfavored by society- seen as a disease or an inconvenience that was brought on individuals who simply went out living on Earth in different ways. Disabled individuals were often segregated from others who weren’t disabled and were often heavily mistreated for being different. Cases like these happened in places such as the Willowbrook State School (1947) in Staten Island. However in modern day history, New York City seems to strive to make sure that disabled individuals are treated equally and fairly among others especially in classrooms.\nIEP stands for Individualized Education Programs and it is a program that offers disabled students the resources and tools they need to be equally successful in the classroom. In order to apply for the IEP program you must be 18 or under and eligible at least of one of the thirteen conditions. These conditions are listed by the NYC Public School Education Department as follows:\n(New York State Senate)\nEvery student who follows the required conditions in order to qualify for IEP (such as autism, dyslexia, etc.) receive a guided track to their courses and a specialized teacher to assist them if need be. The IEP program benefits all students with disabilities by giving equal and fair access to the education that all other students receive. 1 in 16 students are enrolled in IEP programs at their schools. Students in IEP programs receive updates on their academic reports, suggestions to external disability services, and are encouraged to interact in activities with children without disabilities. This makes it so that the child is treated fairly in a public school system community. There will also be services that provide an IEP student the resources they need to succeed in a standard school environment such as alternative exams procedures to accommodate the needs of those with disabilities.\nThe Free Appropriate Public Education Guidelines or FAPE are rules in the public education system that ensures that every single student is treated fairly in schools with disability or not. This includes students with disabilities being integrated with students without disabilities. These rules make sure that every disabled student is cared for and that they are not isolated from the rest of the public school system because of their condition. It is New York’s main goal overtime for FAPE:\nSETSS stands for the Special Education Teacher Support Services and it provides additional instructional service for students in the IEP to be guided by a paraprofessional or faculty that has a background in special educational services. This program offers what is known as resource rooms provided for students who need additional support in educational services such as “math, reading, or braille ’’ as stated on the Teacher Associations Website. The SETSS program offered what are known as direct or indirect services.\n~Direct Services- provide students with close knit education by having teachers teach cognitive skills and social awareness to disabled students so they don’t struggle as much learning in the classrooms.\n~Indirect services- partnership between the special education teacher and the general education teacher working together to accommodate the needs of the disabled student. Cognitive skill development and social awareness are all taught within the regular classroom.\nNew York City’s goal is to make every student equal both inside and outside of the classroom is increasingly successful. More and more students with disabilities are being treated more fairly, this increases New York City’s goal for more inclusive community with people with disabilities and without."

    "text": "In the years 2020 and 2021, students across the country spent their mornings and early afternoons connecting with their classmates and teachers through zoom, while many of their guardians worked from home, attending meetings and working digitally. It wasn’t a perfect system, though— some had to interrupt to apologize that they couldn’t participate at the moment because the audio keeps cutting, or the internet is too slow. In NYC, a quarter of households— a high percentage being black, hispanic, low-income, and/or senior— lack a broadband subscription. Between 11 and 13 percent of students of the DOE had inadequate internet access during remote learning. What the pandemic taught us, among other things, is that our society relies on the internet and the already marginalized are further disadvantaged by lacking access to it (“Access to Internet in NYC”).\nTo improve these conditions— due in large part to “digital redlining” in which internet service providers exhibit discrimination in internet infrastructure in specific geographic areas, facilitating little competition to compete for customers and, therefore, little affordable service— the mayor’s fund supports the digital inclusion fund and the Office of Technology & innovation launched the NYC Internet Master Plan. The National Digital Inclusion Alliance, who’s found examples of the digital redlining which “put redlined communities at a significant disadvantage in attracting and retaining residents and businesses, compared to better-served neighboring areas” contains the New York fund which “supports a range of non-profit partners to deliver equipment and digital literacy programs, enabling public housing residents to maximize their economic and educational advancement” (“New York Digital Inclusion Fund” and Current Initiatives - Mayor’s Fund).\nThe NYC Internet Master Plan, released to give New Yorkers access to necessary tools for “every facet of their lives, including employment, housing, health, and government services,” led to bills aiming to “provide mobile hotspot devices to public school students, raise awareness of affordable internet programs, and increase transparency around cable franchise agreements” (“New York City to Close Digital Divide for 1.6 Million Residents” and “Access to Internet in NYC”). The plan has, for example, started deployment of fiber-optic internet into two affordable housing complexes, and the website already includes portals to amenities such as childcare tracking, online 311, open data, and a wifi kiosk finder—all of which would be thoroughly difficult to find without internet. It even has vaccine appointment finders, mobile apps for emergency updating, a food donation/receiving finder, a work ticket manager, and a crime reporting tool (NYC Office of Technology and Innovation). Having access to these amenities put people at a significant advantage, so it’s extremely important that the city has initiatives to incentivize and support its inclusion for all its residents.\nWorks Cited (annotated):\n“Access to Internet in NYC.” Data Team, https://council.nyc.gov/data/internet-access/.

    "text": "355 Lexington Ave #3, New York, NY 10017\nThis building is the site of City Meals-On-Wheels, a 501c3 organization and a registered NYC charity. Their goal is to tackle the issue of poverty in New York City, particularly among older New Yorkers. The organization all started in November 1981 with Gael Greene, a long-time restaurant critic who read about how food services in New York City didn’t work on weekends and holidays. These services being closed affected older New Yorkers’ ability to get food during the weekends. A month later, Greene gathered her friends in the food and hospitality industry; together, they created about 6,000 meals to share with elderly New Yorkers around Christmas time.\nPoverty is a prevalent issue in New York City, especially among the older population. In 2017, A report from the Center for An Urban Future gathered data via survey from the senior population in New York State. The senior population in New York State grew 31%, while the state’s 65-under population decreased by 2%. In New York City, most of the increase in the elder population is due to an aging immigrant population. In regards to poverty levels, New York City’s 65+ community has a poverty rate of 20%. The study also reported higher poverty rates among Latine, Asian, and Black senior communities.\nSince late 1981, City Meals-On-Wheels has strove to deliver food to older New Yorkers in need. They’re open on weekends and most holidays, but on the holidays they do close on, they give out food in advance so that those in need get food. In 2011, the Mobile Food Pantry started so that those who couldn’t walk to get groceries or the meals themselves were delivered the food at their doorstep.\nBesides food, the organization also has programs that support the elderly in other aspects of life. The Friendly Visiting Program addresses the loneliness and isolation issue among the elderly. According to the official City Meals-On-Wheels website, 57% of meal recipients live alone, 40% almost never leave home, and 8% have no one to talk to. The Friendly Visiting Program tackles this by pairing “caring individuals with homebound elderly neighbors in need of companionship.” Each volunteer dedicates an hour a week for at least 6 months, with a flexible schedule determined between the volunteer and their match. Other forms of social service include sending handmade cards for special occasions and making weekly phone calls to meal recipients.\nSince 1981, City Meals-On-Wheels has delivered over 67 million meals to the older NYC population. Their food and social outreach programs make them wonderful support for elderly New Yorkers. City Meals-On-Wheels is a wonderful example of community support and organization that comes together to help a population in need."

    "title": "Closed NYC Train Stations",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, NYC’s transportation was run by three private corporations: the IRT (Interborough Transit Company), the BMT (Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation) and the IND (Independent Subway System, confusingly). They are part of the reason why there’s so many closed train stations in the city: they became consolidated and run by the city and many routes even became redundant, as they didn’t have to compete with each other at that point. Much of those were demolished to be unusable or simply abandoned and left intact if they didn’t physically hinder the creation of new routes. Those that were demolished for redundancy were mostly elevated lines that had matched routes in underground lines. The rest of the closed stations were usually shuttered because they were close to another station, but some were closed by rare circumstances.\nOne notable station closed due to proximity to other stations was the Court Street Station in Brooklyn, which served as part of the IND’s Fulton Street Line. Being close to other stations in Downtown Brooklyn (which lead to other factors like low ridership and finding transfers obsolete), Court Street Station was abandoned in 1946 ten years after its opening. The soiled walls led the New York City Transit Authority to test a new cleaning method on them in 1960, and sixteen years later this station became home to the New York City Transit Exhibit. Containing preserved subway artifacts, the museum is still open today (now run by the MTA) despite it being planned on closing a year after opening, in 1977.\nSignificant rare circumstances have been present in multiple train station closings. One train station lasted only for a year, and was purpose built for a specific event: the 1939 World Fair. The IND built the Queens station to move people more easily to the fair, but it wasn’t popular since the fare was an extra 5¢, and was demolished when dismantled, not to be reopened in the 1964 Fair. One station that closed and then reopened, though, was the IRT’s Intervale Avenue Station in the Bronx. After a failed robbery of the South Bronx Subway token booth ended in an arson in 1989 (which imitated a previous token robbery in a Brooklyn station, but didn’t kill the clerk), the station was closed until it finished vigorous reconstruction in 1992.\nAnother even more unfortunate event was responded with a train station closure and reopening as well. The IRT’s WTC Cortland Station in Manhattan was under ground zero of the September 11th attacks, and was rebuilt and opened in 2018. However, BMT’s Cortlandt Street Station, which also sustained damage, was closed and rebuilt for a year after 2001, reopened, but then again permanently to make way for the building of Dey Street Passageway and the rebuilding of the World Trade Station."

    "text": "The General Slocum disaster was one of the deadliest maritime disasters in U.S. history. It occurred on June 15, 1904, when the steamship General Slocum caught fire and sank in the East River of New York City. The ship was carrying over a thousand people, mostly women and children from the German-American community who were on a church outing.\nThe disaster was a result of a combination of factors, including outdated safety measures and equipment, lack of proper training and inspections, and negligence on the part of the ship’s crew. The lifeboats on board were rotten and unusable, and the life jackets were filled with cork that had disintegrated over time, rendering them useless. The crew was not trained to handle emergencies, and the ship’s owner had not conducted proper safety inspections.\nAs a result of the fire, many passengers were trapped below deck and unable to escape. Others jumped into the river, but many of them could not swim and drowned. The fire burned so intensely that many of the victims were burned beyond recognition. In total, over a thousand people lost their lives in the disaster, the majority of whom were women and children.\nThe disaster had a significant impact on the German-American community, who had been the primary passengers on the ship. The tragedy was felt deeply, and many families were devastated by the loss of loved ones. The disaster led to changes in safety regulations, including stricter inspections and requirements for safety equipment, to prevent similar tragedies in the future.\nCaptain William Van Schaick was the captain of the General Slocum when it caught fire and sank. He was found guilty of criminal negligence in the disaster and sentenced to 10 years in prison. However, he was released after serving less than four years due to good behavior. After his release, he was unable to find work as a captain and worked as a clerk until his death in 1927.\n\nSources\nKing, Gilbert. n.d. “A Spectacle of Horror – The Burning of the General Slocum.” Smithsonian Magazine.
