<p>This page was created at the end of the semester. Weekly assignments were generally posted on Blackboard or the share notion workspace.</p>
<section id="week-1-introductions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-1-introductions">Week 1: Introductions</h2>
<p>Posted on Blackboard:</p>
<p>This is a discussion board forum for our next class Monday, January 30th.</p>
<p>Your assignment is to read two sections of the textbook: “About the series” (1 page), and the introduction (20 pages). These sections explain the purpose, motivation and structure of the textbook.</p>
<p>We are using this textbook as one method to learn about the people of NYC. We will also create our own version of a book like this for the semester long project.</p>
<p>Keeping these issues in mind, we will have a group discussion about the reading in our next class</p>
<p>Discussion forum assignment:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a new thread in this forum, and:</p></li>
<li><p>In your thread write a question that could be used to guide our class discussion about the reading. The question can be about about the reading, and/or about how it relates to our class learning goals. When we have our class discussion, we will look at the questions in this forum and talk about them in person.</p></li>
<li><p>If someone else has already posted your question, you could give that one a bump, but please also make a new question so we have lots of them to discuss.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>I will get us started by creating my own thread, and asking a question I had.</p>
<p>See you all on Monday!</p>

<section id="week-2-the-bronx-and-group-presentations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-2-the-bronx-and-group-presentations">Week 2: The Bronx and Group Presentations</h2>
<p>In preparation for week 2 you have read the textbook chapter on The Bronx. The class assignment for this week is to create and deliver a short 3 minute presentation about one of the sites in the chapter.</p>
<p>Monday, February 6th is a workshop day where you will work with your partner to prepare the presentation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose a unique site of interest from the textbook to present</p></li>
<li><p>Plan out the presentation for Wednesday</p></li>
<li><p>Participate in class discussions about the goals for our presentations</p></li>
</ol>
<p>See also the attached “Oral Presentation Tips” document that we will discuss in class. It has many good tips, and we will modify aspects of it for our purposes. Wednesday is presentation day or practice talk day. Each pair will deliver their 3 minute presentation followed by questions from the group.</p>
<p>Use this assignment to submit the powerpoint, google slides, or other content that you want to present. The deadline is 2pm Wednesday 8th, 2023 (I need time to make sure everything works). Bring your laptop just in case.</p>
<p>NOTE: only one person needs to upload the content for the pair, decide in advance who will be responsible for this step</p>
<p>These are the general guidelines for the presentations that I had on the projector during class:</p>
<p>General Guidelines</p>
<p>Time: 3 minutes, each partner gives half of the talk. 1.5 minutes per person (4.5 minutes for groups of 3).</p>
<p>Audience: Assume a general audience</p>
<p>Content: What are the points I want to convey? What do I want the audience to learn? When audience members remember my talk the following day, what main point do I want them to remember?</p>
<p>Organization:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduce yourselves</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce your site, establish the goal of your presentation</p></li>
<li><p>Describe the site: Give no more than a one-minute summary of the site</p></li>
<li><p>Feel free to go beyond the textbook description to help portray the site and its importance</p></li>
<li><p>Site reflection/discussion: What issues are raised by this site? What are the broader contexts at play? What are the important takeaways from this example?</p></li>
<li><p>Conclude with a summary of your main points.</p></li>
</ul>

<section id="week-3-notion-and-note-taking" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-3-notion-and-note-taking">Week 3: Notion and note-taking</h2>
<p>Note: a notion.so workspace was created and each student was invited to join. From this point forward most assignments were completed on notion pages.</p>
<p>Your assignment is to engage the reading with a note-taking process using notion. This is an open-ended and unstructured assignment where you get to define and explore your own note-taking process. Whatever you decide to do, it should help you engage more deeply with the reading (e.g., help you remember important details, attempt to synthesize information by jotting ideas down, generating questions, critically evaluating ideas, locating other source material, etc.)</p>
<p>When you join the class notion you will find your own page in the list of member pages. Use this page to add your notes about the Manhattan reading. You can structure them however you want. You can add subpages and subpages of notes within your own member page.</p>
<p>This is a shared space so you will be able to see what everyone else does. We can even add comments to each other. As we are learning this system please do not delete content in a member page that is not your own. To get full points for this assignment I expect your notion page will be full of your notes by our next class. In that class we will discuss the reading, your note-taking processes, and how we can use notion as a collaborative space to create content about our class. Submission instructions</p>
<p>If you successfully join notion and add your note-taking process to your member page by the due date (next class), then you do not have to submit anything! I will automatically record your points for this assignment If you had technical difficulties with notion that’s OK, however, I expect you will find another note-taking method and submit evidence of your notes to this assignment. We can figure the notion issue later.</p>
</section>
<section id="week-4" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-4">Week 4</h2>
<p>Theme for the week: “Ourselves and our own experiences”</p>
<p>Overview:</p>
<p>As we continue learning about the people of NYC, we will consider our own roles as individuals in NYC. One assignment is to make an “About me” bio page. Another assignment is to learn about a research method called “Autoethnography” that describes how a researcher may draw upon their own personal experiences as a part of their larger research process.</p>
<p>These are the reading and writing assignments.</p>
<p>Reading:</p>
<p>Autoethnography. Read the attached 12-page manuscript describing a research method termed “Autoethnography”. Continue reading sites from the Manhattan chapter. A minimal goal is to have read and taken notes on at least half of the sites. Choose the ones that most interest you.</p>
<p>Ellis, C., Adams, T. E., &amp; Bochner, A. P. (2011). Autoethnography: An Overview. Historical Social Research / Historische Sozialforschung, 36(4), 273–290.</p>
<p>Writing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Autoethnography. Read the assigned paper and write a reflection about it in at least 500 words. Write your reflection in notion as a new page inside your member page. You can reflect on anything you want about this paper. If you had trouble understanding what this paper is about, discuss what questions you have. What do you think about this method? What are some limitations of the method, or exciting possibilities of the method? What aspects of the piece stood out to you as something for further reflection?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another possibility for your reflection paper is to write about your own experience as a person in NYC. What is it like to be you in NYC? What are you observing? Noticing? Feeling? What issues, concerns, interests and questions do you have from your own experience that relate to themes in this course, and could suggest research directions for topics you want to learn more about.</p>
<p>1.5 points. DUE BEFORE TUESDAY’s class. Submit by making a new page on notion.</p>
<p>Having done the reading and a reflection will allow you to participate in class discussion on Tuesday.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>About me. Share your bio/story with the class. Create an “About Me” subpage in your notion member page. Write a bio and introduce yourself, have fun with it. You can change this at anytime, and it will only be available to our class.</li>
</ol>
<p>1 point. DUE BEFORE Wednesday’s class. Submit by making a new page on notion.</p>
<hr>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Manhattan notes. Continue adding notes about the sites you read from the Manhattan chapter. By Wednesday, you should have read and taken notes on at least half of the sites. Mix-up your note-taking process to try out different strategies. Demonstrate your agency.</li>
</ol>
<p>1 point. DUE BEFORE Wednesday’s class. Submit by adding notes to your existing Manhattan notes.</p>

<section id="week-6-octalogs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="week-6-octalogs">Week 6: Octalogs</h2>
<p>This week we begin the Brooklyn chapter and consider methods from history, the rhetoric of historiography The additional reading presents numerous viewpoints about historical research, in four papers called the Octalogs. The first octalog was in 1988. It occurred at a Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) conference. Eight (octa) panelists at this conference had a few minutes to state their perspective about what historiography is all about. Octalog II happened 12 years later (1997), then Octalog III (2011), and the most recent Octalog IV was disrupted by COVID-19 in 2020, and took place in 2021. Collectively, these vignettes show both a wide range of viewpoints about history and historical research, as well as how those viewpoints have changed within the discipline over the past several decades.</p>
<p>NOTE: each of the octalogs are on notion under the week 6 assignment</p>
