Many previous versions of the course and their resulting course projects are available from [the seminar 2 Encyclopedia](https://eportfolios.macaulay.cuny.edu/encyclopedia/category/all-the-sites/).

## Memory

In Spring 2023, we will explore seminar 2 through the lens of human memory processes to help us examine how we remember, forget, and tell stories about the spectacularly diverse people of New York City.
