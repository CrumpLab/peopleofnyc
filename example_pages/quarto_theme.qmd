As of this rendering, quarto websites render all pages under the [site-wide bootstrap 5 theme](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html), and ignores themes defined for individual pages.

However, if the global theme for the website is set to none, then different themes can be applied to individual pages.

For example, the theme for this website is defined in `_quarto.yml` as:

``` markdown
format:
  html:
    theme: none
    css: css/nav.css
```

And, the theme for this page is defined in the yml header of this .qmd file as:

``` markdown
format: 
  html: 
    theme: minty
```
