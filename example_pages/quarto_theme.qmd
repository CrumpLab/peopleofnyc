As of this rendering, quarto websites render all pages under the [site-wide bootstrap 5 theme](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html), and ignores themes defined for individual pages.

For example, the theme for this website is defined in `_quarto.yml` as:

``` markdown
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
    css: css/nav.css
```

And, the theme for this page is defined in the yml header of this .qmd file as:

``` markdown
format: 
  html: 
    theme: minty
```

However, the minty theme is not overriding the site-wide cosmo theme for this page. Individual pages can be custom themed by including a css file and modifying bootstrap defaults, or by declaring new css classes.
