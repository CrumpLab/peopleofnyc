We already read and discussed the introduction to our textbook [@bankmu√±oz2022]. This class was about trying a different method of class discussion.

The room was big enough to make a big circle for all of us. We sat down opened to the first page of the introduction and had discussion about each paragraph, one at a time.

Discussion goals were to extract and talk about:

1.  What was the paragraph about
2.  What kind of work is this paragraph doing in the overall narrative of the introduction
3.  What themes or issues did this bring up that you want to discuss?
4.  How is the paragraph setting up future content in the introduction, or resonating with prior content
5.  How are claims in these paragraphs being supported?

And so on.

We only got through the first 4-5 pages, but there wasn't a posted speed limit, so our pace was totally fine for emphasizing depth over breadth.

## Moderating equal time

The class organically did a good job of sharing the floor in terms of who was generating discussion about each paragraph. I came prepared to moderate this if necessary. I printed out a spreadsheet with everyone's name and started to check off boxes whenever anyone spoke. My plan was to make sure everyone was contributing as much as possible. I found it difficult to listen and search for boxes to check at the same time, so I stopped tracking this.

I remember seeing a discussion tracking activity somewhere that could be an alternative. It looked something like this:

![](images/tracking_discussion.jpg)Each person gets a sheet of paper, and as the group has a discussion the members trace lines show who spoke. The paper keeps a record of turn taking. We might try this at some point to see how it lands.
