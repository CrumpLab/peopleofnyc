This is a course blog for our version of Seminar 2. It will start out as an instructor blog, and my plan is to contribute posts roughly once a week about things we have accomplished in class and/or plan to do next. This blog could be helpful as a reference for us as we go through the semester, and it could be helpful for other sections now or later.
